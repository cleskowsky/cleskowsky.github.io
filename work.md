# Burnout

Sometimes I find stories about people who have taken on too much (work? responsibility?) and have to step back an reset. It's hard to tell when it's happening to you or somebody you know because often a person looks totally normal right up until the crash. I think I've experienced something like this myself and find reading about it helps me remember those times.

It's super important for teams to be aware that this sort of thing can be (and probably is) happening.
