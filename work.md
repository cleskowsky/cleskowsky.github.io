# Tech Leads

* [Tom's learnings after becoming a tech lead](https://tomgamon.com/posts/things-i-have-learned-new-tech-lead/): I like these. I bet he was feeling like an imposter for quite awhile before coming to these insights. Going from an individual contributor to a leader can be a bumpy road ...

# Security

* Input validation (Anti-corruption layer)
* Output encoding

# Burnout

Sometimes I find stories about people who have taken on too much (work? responsibility?) and have to step back an reset. It's hard to tell when it's happening to you or somebody you know because often a person looks totally normal right up until the crash. I think I've experienced something like this myself and find reading about it helps me remember those times.

It's super important for teams to be aware that this sort of thing can be (and probably is) happening.

# SRE

# Process

* [Cut Out Time Estimates on Roadmaps: Get Into a Product Delivery Rhythm](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/product-strategy-and-roadmap-timing/): Product delivery process used at Honeycomb. Tight deadlines for most things are de-emphasized a bit it seems. Work is picked up in chunks of varying size and progress updated at regular cadences (the idea is with this kind of process spending time drilling into trying to figure out exactly how long something will take to complete is a fool's errand):
  * yearly - The roadmap is updated yearly but often changes. Headings are: in progress, next and planned
  * quarterly - OKRs. Much more likely to be happening. Company aligns around these ideas. Not necessarily specific at this level.
  * 6 weeks - Things get real
  * 2 weeks - Updates provided broadly about what has changed since last time by functional area
  * weekly - 30m demo days to show off work in progress
  * daily - Team syncs. "Keep talking about the work and make sure everyone's got the plot". I like this language!
