# Production

* Incident Response
    * Communication during incident response is super important. Internally, the customer support team needs to know something is up because customers may be calling in to ask why our software isn't working. Externally, customers directly impacted by an outage may want to keep up to date on the status of the outage and when a fix is likely to land. Somebody responsible for communicating the status of an incident while it's being worked should be appointed right away when the response team forms.

          * Summary
          * Who was affected?
          * What happened?
          * What we're doing to make sure it doesn't happen again?

# Burnout

Sometimes I find stories about people who have taken on too much (work? responsibility?) and have to step back an reset. It's hard to tell when it's happening to you or somebody you know because often a person looks totally normal right up until the crash. I think I've experienced something like this myself and find reading about it helps me remember those times.

It's super important for teams to be aware that this sort of thing can be (and probably is) happening.
