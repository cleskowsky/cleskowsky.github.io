* [Ripgrep, rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): A better grep.
* [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A nicer cat for linux. If you're cat'ing a file this will add colour and line numbers. It's smart about it though. If cat is part of a pipeline where you probably don't want that character stream modified it doesn't. I've added an alias for cat -> bat.
* [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/): Use pictures of cats into mockups with a nice api for specifying dimensions. So great this one.
