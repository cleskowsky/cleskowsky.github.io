* [Ripgrep, rg](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep): A better grep.
* [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat): A nicer cat for linux. If you're cat'ing a file this will add colour and line numbers. It's smart about it though. If cat is part of a pipeline where you probably don't want that character stream modified it doesn't. I've added an alias for cat -> bat.
* [Placekitten](https://placekitten.com/): Use pictures of cats into mockups with a nice api for specifying dimensions. So great this one.
* [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org): The browser i'm using these days
  * plugins
    * tabliss for a new tab photo with quick links
    * 1password is the password manager I'm using these days
    * ublock origin because there are way too many ads on the internet
* [Bruno api client](https://www.usebruno.com/): Send authenticated test requests to an api and read back responses during development
