# Services I have helped run in the past

* [Sending email](/2021/09/30/sending-email.html)
  * Email is delightful :)

# Ansible

* `ansible-playbook -i "localhost" playbook-nagios.yml --list-tasks`: Lists plays that will be run by ansible
* `ansible hostgroup -i inv -m shell -a "command"`: Execute task <command> across all hosts in group hostgroup in inventory inv

# AWS

* `aws sts get-caller-identity`: Gets the apiuser for my current apikey

# Bash

**Beautiful bash**

* [gradlew](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/gradlew)
* [locust run-redistributed-headless.sh](https://github.com/locustio/locust/blob/master/scripts/run-disributed-headless.sh) This one has a nice capture of process ids in an array with looping

# Frontend

* [html5boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) a reasonable starting point for frontend projects. Pretty much everything you could ever be worried about is here üôÇ [This is similar but much simpler](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/)

* [Setting up Vue computed properties for unit tests with vue-test-utils](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50437699/setting-up-vue-computed-properties-for-unit-tests-with-vue-test-utils) In the past, I have had to override a computed value to create specific test context

# Java

* [Db migrations in java](https://flywaydb.org/): Incredibly Spring data doesn‚Äôt have a story for db migrations out of the box (It seems to have everything else!)
* [Elasticsearch's guidance for setting java's heap size](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/advanced-configuration.html#set-jvm-heap-size): 50% of main memory available in a system is a recommendation I've read in a couple of places now

## Performance analysis

**CPU**

{% highlight bash %}
# If cpu usage is high, dumping threads in the jvm may help
# identify what work is being done. Taking multiple dumps
# at 10s intervals will help spot threads that have been running,
# or been blocked for a long time.
#
# If a problem is lots of threads running for a short amount
# of time, a 10s interval may not show that readily. (I should
# look into java flame graphs for java!)
#
# Intellij can help analyze thread dumps. Look for the analyze
# thread dump action.
jstack <pid>

# A stronger version
sudo jstack -F <pid>
{% endhighlight %}

* [netflix: java flame graphs](https://netflixtechblog.com/java-in-flames-e763b3d32166)

**Memory**

{% highlight bash %}
# Look at garbage collection stats in the jvm
sudo jstat -gcutil -h10 1002 250 20
S0     S1     E      O      M     CCS    YGC     YGCT    FGC    FGCT     GCT

...

S0 - surviver space 1 utilization
S1 - surviver space 1 utilization
E - Eden space utilization
O - Old gen space utilization
M - ?
CCS - ?
YGC - # of young garbage collections
YGCT - young gc time (units?)
FGC - full garbage collections
FGCT - full garbage collection time
GCT - garbage collection time

Collect 20 samples, from java process with pid 1002, at 250ms intervals,
and reprint the header every 10 lines of output

No header line
sudo jstat -gcutil <pid> 250 7
{% endhighlight %}

**JConsole**

A program that ships with the jdk that lets you introspect a running java process. (You can see exposed jmx beans, heap memory, threads, and a few other things) I usually use it to look at jmx beans

{% highlight bash %}
# Figure out the pid of your java process doing something like this or pidof ...
ps aux | grep java

# The run
jconsole

# JConsole will display a list of java processes it finds on your system. Pick the one you want!
{% endhighlight %}

Note: I have only ever done this in dev

**SDK Man**

Install and run with several jdk versions (And other tools I think)

Links
* [SDKMan!](https://sdkman.io/)

**Cacerts, trust store, root certs**

{% highlight bash %}
# View trusted root certs in centos
keytool -list -keystore /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts -storepass changeit

# View an ssl cert from a remote host
openssl s_client -showcerts -connect telusemrapi.telushealth.com:443

# View a particular cert in my trust store
# Get alias from the cert list command above
keytool -list -v -keystore /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/java/cacerts -alias digicertassuredidrootca -storepass changeit

# Linux

* `zip -er a.zip a/`: Creates an encrypted zipfile of contents with folders from a/

* `split -l 50 filename`: Splits file into 50 line chunks names xaa, xab, xac, ...
* `mkfs.xfs /dev/sdc`: Make an xfs filesystem

**Connection Strings**

{% highlight bash %}
# DNS seed list (Mongodb > 3.6)
# We can setup a srv record that contains many or all hosts in a mongodb
# replica set
mongodb+srv://db.cluster.env/dbname
# This will pull a list of ips,ports from that srv record and connect to
# one host. After successfully connecting to the replicaset it will ask the
# rs for further hosts
#
# There are options that can be passed along with this (standard ones) and
# this mode can also lookup a corresponding TXT record to get the replicaset
# name + authdb

# Standard connection string
mongodb://[username:password@]host1[:port1][,...hostN[:portN]][/[database][?options]]
# You can explicitly list all members of a replica set using this method
# I believe the driver only needs to find one replica set member and then
# can discover others and even follow mongo elections

# Postfix

## Various helpful commands

{% highlight bash %}
# Re-enqueue messages held back for a few days (Resets their timestamp
# for remaining in delivery queues)
postsuper -r [<QUEUEID>|ALL]

# Generates a report about messages in postfix queues, by email domain
# and time spent in queue (works for other postfix queues too!)
qshape deferred

# Get me a list of messages currently in the active queue (and possibly
# other queues eg hold)
mailq
{% endhighlight %}

## A few more links about postfix :)

* [Postfix architecture (input handlers, queues, output handlers)](http://www.postfix.org/OVERVIEW.html): Fairly important for understanding how postfix works
* [SPF records](https://postmarkapp.com/guides/spf): Qualifiers, mechanisms, oh my! This is a way to validate the FROM address of a message. That the sender (ip) is permitted to send email on behalf of the domain in from:. Works with dns
* [Basic postfix config](http://www.postfix.org/BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.html): Good high level guidance for setting up postfix for specific use cases
* [Extend postfix smtpd input filtering with custom code](http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html): We were looking for a way to show backpressure to clients based on health of active and deferred queues (Don‚Äôt accept new messages addressed to email service providers we are currently having delivery trouble with. eg A large number of delayed messages). This may be a way to do that
* [On destination rate delays](http://postfix.1071664.n5.nabble.com/Rate-limiting-td75185.html): If you are relaying directly to email service providers, the rate means 1 per domain. If indirect on the other hand, domain == ‚Äòsmtp nexthop‚Äô. If you only have one of these ‚Äì ie you‚Äôre sending messages to an internal smtp server that relays through another before external delivery ‚Äì domain in this case is NOT the recipient address domain. It is the relay server. If you only have 1 of these, then email will go out 1 at a time at the defined period

Reverse DNS (ptr) records

> Mail servers will cross-check your SMTP server‚Äôs advertised HELO hostname against the PTR record for the connecting IP address, and then check that the returned name has an address record matching the connecting IP address. If any of these checks fail, then your outgoing mail may be rejected or marked as spam.
>
> So, you need to set all three consistently: The server‚Äôs hostname and the name in the PTR record must match, and that name must resolve to the same IP address.
>
> Note that these do not have to be the same as the domain names for which you are sending mail, and it‚Äôs common that they are not.
