# Bash

* [gradlew](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-java-instrumentation/blob/main/gradlew) Beautiful bash #1
* [locust run-redistributed-headless.sh](https://github.com/locustio/locust/blob/master/scripts/run-disributed-headless.sh) Beautiful bash #2 : This one has a nice capture of process ids in an array with looping
* [Documented bash ‚Äòset‚Äô shell modifiers](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html) (eg What does set -e mean?)

# Frontend

* [html5boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/) a reasonable starting point for frontend projects. Pretty much everything you could ever be worried about is here üôÇ [This is similar but much simpler](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/html-boilerplate/)
* [Vue instance lifecycle events](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/instance.html#Lifecycle-Diagram)
* [Setting up Vue computed properties for unit tests with vue-test-utils](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50437699/setting-up-vue-computed-properties-for-unit-tests-with-vue-test-utils) In the past, I have had to override a computed value to create specific test context

# Java

* [Db migrations in java](https://flywaydb.org/): Incredibly Spring data doesn‚Äôt have a story for db migrations out of the box (It seems to have everything else!)
* [Elasticsearch's guidance for setting java's heap size](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/advanced-configuration.html#set-jvm-heap-size): 50% of main memory available in a system is a recommendation I've read in a couple of places now

# Linux

* `zip -er a.zip a/`: Creates an encrypted zipfile of contents with folders from a/
* `dd if=/dev/zero of=a.txt bs=1024 count=10240`: Create a 10m ‚Äúempty‚Äù file for testing (10k chunks, at 1024 bytes per chunk)
* `pstree -s tomcat`: Show processes containing tomcat in their commandline (brew install pstree)

# MacOS

* `cmd + shift + .` Reveals hidden files in a finder window. eg ~/.sdkman/

# MongoDB

* `mongodump --archive=a.gz --gzip --db <dbname>`: Takes a logical backup
* `mongorestore --archive=a.gz --gzip`: Restores a logical db backup
* [Update arrays in a document](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/node/fundamentals/crud/write-operations/embedded-arrays/): Modify an array in a document using $ and $[] notation

# OpenSSL

{% highlight bash %}
# Generate a private key in pem format
openssl genrsa -out key.pem 2048
# Then do this if I need a public key too
openssl rsa -in key.pem -outform PEM -pubout -out public.pem

# Generate a public/private key in rsa format (Can be used with github + SSH)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Github recommends creating a key with the ed25519 algorithm
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"

# Postfix

{% highlight bash %}
# Re-enqueue messages held back for a few days (Resets their timestamp
# for remaining in delivery queues)
postsuper -r [<QUEUEID>|ALL]

# Generates a report about messages in postfix queues, by email domain
# and time spent in queue (works for other postfix queues too!)
qshape deferred

# Get me a list of messages currently in the active queue (and possibly
# other queues eg hold)
mailq
{% endhighlight %}

_Email entering postfix queues_

_Email leaving postfix_
![Outbound email](/assets/images/postfix-queues-2.png)

* [Postfix architecture (input handlers, queues, output handlers)](http://www.postfix.org/OVERVIEW.html): Fairly important for understanding how postfix works
* [SPF records](https://postmarkapp.com/guides/spf): Qualifiers, mechanisms, oh my! This is a way to validate the FROM address of a message. That the sender (ip) is permitted to send email on behalf of the domain in from:. Works with dns
* [Basic postfix config](http://www.postfix.org/BASIC_CONFIGURATION_README.html): Good high level guidance for setting up postfix for specific use cases
* [Extend postfix smtpd input filtering with custom code](http://www.postfix.org/SMTPD_POLICY_README.html): We were looking for a way to show backpressure to clients based on health of active and deferred queues (Don‚Äôt accept new messages addressed to email service providers we are currently having delivery trouble with. eg A large number of delayed messages). This may be a way to do that
* [On destination rate delays](http://postfix.1071664.n5.nabble.com/Rate-limiting-td75185.html): If you are relaying directly to email service providers, the rate means 1 per domain. If indirect on the other hand, domain == ‚Äòsmtp nexthop‚Äô. If you only have one of these ‚Äì ie you‚Äôre sending messages to an internal smtp server that relays through another before external delivery ‚Äì domain in this case is NOT the recipient address domain. It is the relay server. If you only have 1 of these, then email will go out 1 at a time at the defined period

## Reverse DNS (ptr) records

> Mail servers will cross-check your SMTP server‚Äôs advertised HELO hostname against the PTR record for the connecting IP address, and then check that the returned name has an address record matching the connecting IP address. If any of these checks fail, then your outgoing mail may be rejected or marked as spam.
> 
> So, you need to set all three consistently: The server‚Äôs hostname and the name in the PTR record must match, and that name must resolve to the same IP address.
> 
> Note that these do not have to be the same as the domain names for which you are sending mail, and it‚Äôs common that they are not.

> [Reverse dns records (ptr)](https://serverfault.com/questions/815054/reverse-dns-setup-for-an-ip-with-multiple-domains): A discussion of how they‚Äôre used. The first comment is the most helpful (Included here for posterity :))

# Perf

## First 60 seconds: What to look at first when diagnosing a performance issue on a linux vm
{% highlight bash %}
# load averages
uptime

# kernel messages can be helpful sometimes
dmesg | tail

# rolling process, memory stats
vmstat 1

# rolling cpu states on multicore systems
mpstat -P ALL 1

# rolling ps aux (only shows non-idle processes)
pidstat 1

# rolling disk performance metrics
iostat -xz 1

# available memory, used, swap
free -m

# network visibility
sar -n DEV 1
sar -n TCP,ETCP 1

# running processes in a system
top
{% endhighlight %}

## And other helpful commands

* `pidstat 2 [n]`: Samples process resource utilization like top at 2s intervals (n times if specified)

# Python

* `python3 -m http.server 8000`: Runs an http server in the current dir

# Yum

{% highlight bash %}
# list installed packages
yum list installed

# list package updates
yum check-update

# list package updates (security only)
yum check-update --security

# apply updates
yum update

# apply security updates
yum update --security

# get info about a package
yum info python3
{% endhighlight %}
