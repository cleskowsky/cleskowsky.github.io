# Split Pea Soup (From Bill)

## Ingredients

* 2 1/2 L water
* 2 1/4 C green split peas ; dried
* 2 onion ; chopped finely
* 2 celery ribs ; chopped finely
* 2 carrots ; chopped finely
* 2 potatoes ; peeled and chopped
* 4 bouillon cubes

## Steps

In a large stock pot, bring the water to a boil. Add the rest of the ingredients.

Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the vegetables are soft. Using an immersion blender, blend the soup a bit to create a creamy, smoother consistency.
