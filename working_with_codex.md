# Planning prompts

## Starting a planning session 1

> I want to enable custom, unobtrusive update notifications and installs by customizing SPUUserDriver. Let's start by planning the custom UI we'll need. We'll ONLY work on UI. Create a plan for creating SwiftUI views that can show the various states that are required by SPUUserDriver. I think the best place for these to show up is in the macOS window titlebars on the top-right. Create a plan to put it there. Consult the oracle.

## Starting a planning session 2

> I've got an idea I want to talk through with you. I'd like you to help me turn it into a fully formed design and spec (and eventually an implementation plan)
> Check out the current state of the project in our working directory to understand where we're starting off, then ask me questions, one at a time, to help refine the idea.
> Ideally, the questions would be multiple choice, but open-ended questions are OK, too. Don't forget: only one question per message.
> Once you believe you understand what we're doing, stop and describe the design to me, in sections of maybe 200-300 words at a time, asking after each section whether it looks right so far.

## Add multiplayer to a simple game

Chatgpt suggested this one:

> I have a simple turn-based game written in Python using Pygame. I want to add multiplayer support so that two players can play against each other over the internet. The game is currently single-player only. Can you help me plan out how to implement this feature? Please provide a step-by-step plan, including any necessary changes to the game's architecture, networking considerations, and how to handle player turns and synchronization. Let's start with a high-level overview of the steps involved.

Alternate start from [a 5m codex video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqNzfK4_meQ):

> Write a plan to implement multiplayer

# Develop session

* "Consult the oracle" kicks an agent into a "deeper thinking" mode which often produces better results
* Starts with a plan because he doesn't know what the feature should look like and do yet and he won't get a lot of value out of sending an agent off to write a bunch of code initially
* The plan is saved to a file like spec.md and often included as context in future conversations
* Uses AI for inspiration
  * Getting from 0 to 1 is hard and is like staring at a blank slate
  * Use the AI to give you something ... anything
  * Often the first iteration is thrown away
  * Sometimes he does the work manually
  * Almost always he has a better sense of what he wants after working with it
* Be able to tell when the agent is producing junk
* Review everything and for stuff that isn't understood he will try to learn about it
* He learns in parallel with the agent (doesn't walk away after a green bar)

# Cleanup session

* Agent is asked to refactor and add documentation
* Documenation helps future work by humans and agents
* Agents work better if they can review code and written documenation
* Refactoring well means a human has understood everything and not blindy accepted what an agent has written
* "Cleanup == anti-slop session"

# Failure and what to do next

* Sometimes you can't get an agent to do what you want it to
  * Along the way it's best to be learning about what you're trying to do
  * You're prompts should be getting closer to the correct work you want to see
  * You can choose to
    * Put the work down for now and move on to something else (Maybe after more context is available the agent performs better)
    * Or do it manually

# Scaffolding out a feature

* Sometimes starting with a few empty classes, methods, and documentation is a good strategy
* "Fill in the black" or "Draw the rest of the owl" are patterns ai is good at

# Sometimes helpful starting prompts

* "I broke a bunch of things, please fix my mess"

# Codex commands

* init - reads files in a directory and generates an agents.md file
* approvals - read only for the llm or directory only (auto) or full access
* model - switch to a simpler / harder reasoning model
* codex resume - continues a session started previously

    * Write Plan
    * Write a checklist
    * Do the checklist
    * Delete the checklist
  * Just tell it to try something (if it gets it wrong it's fine)
  * Throughput > latency (Start multiple tasks at once)
  * Try giving a goal not detailed instructions and commands to validate work
  * Git it to summarize a long article or documentation
