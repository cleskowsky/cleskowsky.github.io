* [Fraggle Rock Reboot](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/jordan-canning-fraggle-rock-1.6256914): This was one of my favourite shows growing up! :)
* [Challenging assumptions (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3_7geJirto&t=3223s): Talk by Liz Fong-Jones and Fred Herbert about fighting the tendency to compare what's happening right now to things that came before. They talked about recency bias. Also the difference between mental models and reality came up. Design is often an afterthought when designing systems and methods of control for those systems but it can often be at the root of a team's trouble wrangling said system
* [GC progress from JDK8 to JDK17](https://kstefanj.github.io/2021/11/24/gc-progress-8-17.html): GC in the jvm has evolved quite a bit since 1.8. ZGC starts to look really interesting. (Sounds like G1 is the default collector since Java9.) What you care about with a gc strategy is throughput (gc introduces minimal or no impact to workload in the jvm we care about, alt. % of total time not spent in gc), latency (time spent in gc) and footprint (gc resource usage is constant and minimal)
* [Snowflakes as code](https://infrastructure-as-code.com/book/2021/11/19/snowflakes-as-code.html): Yeah I'm guilty of this one. Different environments each describing low level resources that have been copied from already existing ones with certain properties changed. Better would be to describe resources once in a way that can be reused by different environments. (eg terraform has modules) You should only be specifying simple properties in different envs ideally (eg instance types, logical names, etc)
