* [Notes about dig by Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/12/04/how-to-use-dig/): Today I learned about the .digrc. I can put +noall and +answer in it do get minimal output from dig for most things and then add +all for a full response if I want which includes error, authority and answer sections. dig +trace is a command I haven't used before. I guess this is how websites that show you a lot of detail about how a dns query is fully resolved from root servers down to authority ones work
