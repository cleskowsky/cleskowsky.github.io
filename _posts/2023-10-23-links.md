Going to trying making 1 post a week for notes from article reading. :) 

# Links

* [Using load shedding to avoid overload](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/using-load-shedding-to-avoid-overload/): Lots of good ideas in this paper. What happens when a workload is applied to a server that is more than it can handle? Can we be in control of what happens next to some degree rather than just saying availability goes to 0? When a backend is slow, clients time out (from their point of view this is indistinguishable from a failure) and often retry. The backend work doesn't necessarily stop ... it just won't be delivered to anyone and the effort is lost. Not a good situation.
  * Be careful about what is shed (eg if load balancer health checks fail a server might be removed from production which would be bad when what you need is capacity)
  * Monitor the behaviour of these controls
  * Give priority to work that is more complete than new work (eg if you have to prioritize a request for page 5 or page 1 of a resource do page 5 because the system has already expended effort in generating pages 1-4)
  * Don't accept work when you're already overloaded
  * Throw away work that's probably so old as to be useless at this point (watch queues for this kind of stuff)
  * Be aware that there are queues everywhere in the system (watch them, limit them, what does normal look like)
* [Modern CSS](https://moderncss.dev/): A resource for advanced techniques and ways of thinking about how css, and modern browsers work.
* [The power of two random choices](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2012/01/17/two-random.html): Compares load balancer strategies for selecting a host to pass a request back to. Best of 2 random choices (least busy) is the best all around performer by quite a bit. (Best of n more generally) Performance is related to timeliness of busyness info of workers in the system.
* [A (more) Modern CSS Reset](https://andy-bell.co.uk/a-more-modern-css-reset/): Love finding stuff like this. CSS rules + the reasoning behind them for modern browsers circa 2023 by Andy Bell.

* [The Flight Plan to Emission Free Aviation • Anita Sengupta • GOTO 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q_O9pmSpg_8): Hydrogen fuel cells are our best bet for stored energy for use by transport industry. (Planes, cars, boats) I didn't know anything about this plan for storage and generation of electricity. Very cool! Anita Sengupta is passionate about this stuff and a joy to listen to and watch.

# Lyrics

milet – Anytime Anywhere (English Translation Lyrics)[Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End Ending Song]

And you alright?
Can you hear me?

I trace along the empty railroad tracks
I want you to cry and laugh out loud
Holding onto vivid and painful memories
I want to say it in words that are much more important than a goodbye
Ordinary but special

Look
Why are things that I couldn’t see with these eyes overflowing?

So even if I want to be reborn
I would choose this place again
So if I meet you again
I won’t let you go
I guess I’ll choose now

Even if there’s no promise
Even on days when I feel lonely and lost
Even those tears are okay
I’m sure the dawn will come

And I am alright (I’ll be alright)
Yeah I hear you (I care about you)

The wind is playing with my long hair
Everything has a meaning, even the days when I stopped
I just realized that I caught up with you

Look
Why are things that I couldn’t see with these eyes overflowing?

So even if I want to be reborn
I would choose this place again
So if I meet you again
I won’t let you go
I guess I’ll choose now

Show me your smile wherever you are
Whenever I close my eyes
Look at me as I walk away

I want to see you again but I won’t say it
Hey, can I remember you just for today?
So if I meet you again
I won’t hesitate anymore, I’ll choose now

Even if there’s no promise
Even on days when I feel lonely and lost
My chest hurts so much
Is it proof that I was with you?

Even if there is no such thing as absolute nothing, it will always arrive
Even those tears are okay, I’m sure the dawn will come

I’m whispering our lullaby for you to come back home
