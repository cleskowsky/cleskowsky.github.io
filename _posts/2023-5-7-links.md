* [So many bad takes â€” What is there to learn from the Prime Video microservices to monolith story](https://adrianco.medium.com/so-many-bad-takes-what-is-there-to-learn-from-the-prime-video-microservices-to-monolith-story-4bd0970423d4): Pushback that the main idea from this story is microservices are bad, monoliths are good. Probably more of a choice to be made given goals, and context. The idea that everything should be written in a tiny function / event driven style between many processes is probably ridiculous but there are advantages. And disadvantages. Think about them. Adrian points to the microservices book by Sam Newman which I'll likely pick up. The table of contents looks interesting. :)
