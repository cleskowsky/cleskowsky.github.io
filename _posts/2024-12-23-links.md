* [AWS re:Invent 2024 - Optimizing performance and cost with AWS Graviton (DEV302)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSdScyCFsFI): Liz Fong-Jones talks about Honeycomb's use of arm64 and how they got there
* [Mercari's production readiness checklist for new services](https://github.com/cleskowsky/production-readiness-checklist/blob/master/docs/references/pre-production-checklist.md): List of stuff to think about while building a new service. Also described are service levels with minimum preparedness criteria. I guess the sre / platform team won't help keep a service up if these designed in good production practices aren't they. (The minimum bar is pretty low and a team can choose what their practice will look like.)
