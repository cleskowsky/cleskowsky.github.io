# Garbage Collection

* [Java Garbage Collection Distilled](https://mechanical-sympathy.blogspot.com/2013/07/java-garbage-collection-distilled.html): From the mechanical sympathy blog, a 2013 post that is out of date in terms of what GC algorithms are out there these days but discusses the issues well:
  * Stop the world pauses
  * Safe points are spots in a program where threads can pause and memory will be in a consistent state. (at the tails of loops, methods, etc.) GCs will force all threads to stop here during a gcs, ([minor and full usually need to do this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64981896/java-gc-is-minor-gc-collection-a-stw-event)) the more threads there are in an app the longer this takes
  * Heap organization for the major collectors that existed at the time. eg ParallelGC uses a small number of regions - young, survivor x n, tenured and G1 uses small, equal sized regions of memory
  * Tunables related to gc management
  * [How to monitor management of gc in a system](https://visualvm.github.io): Visual vm does look neat!
