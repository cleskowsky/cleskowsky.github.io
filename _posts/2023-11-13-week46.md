* [The origin of Ruby on Rails](https://world.hey.com/dhh/the-origin-of-ruby-on-rails-b3dab24e): Haven't used ror professionally but it has had an impact on my work life for sure. It has influenced many frameworks.
* [Wild World](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/10/25/Wild-World): "You donâ€™t have to keep it together. Losing it sometimes is OK."
* [Gov.uk design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/): Guidelines for gov't sites including color, layout, patterns of data collection with forms, and ready made components. This looks very helpful for developers and designers.
