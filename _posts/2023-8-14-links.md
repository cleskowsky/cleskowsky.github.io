tl;dr I have decided to leave Boom Supersonic

About 2 years ago I was chilling on a sailboat when I got a call from Barb

She asked for a 5 minute call.

Since I consider her a friend I answered the call. As I picked it up I heard this being said very quickly, "carbon fiber supersonic jets with 3D printed parts!" | laughed and said, "you've got more than 5 minutes..

Just a few days later I was working at Boom.

It has been an amazing ride. In just 2 years we were able to:
- Renegotiate contracts and save many Smillions.
- Implement significantly more security while making systems easier to use with tools like Okta and RPA
- Bring security up to government level and measurement standards.
- Getting cyber insurance in place.
- Bring the team to the perfect blend of diversity in terms of gender, race, age and skill levels. This is the closest and most supportive team I've ever worked with.
- Self funded doubling the team size and adding a dedicated security team that makes up 33% of the headcount of the IT team. 1to3 seems to be a great ratio at this size.
- Implementation of SAP in a record setting 3 months and getting the chance to speak to 25,000 people about it.
- Being nominated for and being chosen as a finalist for Colorado CIO of the year.

I feel great about the company and the mission and about my part in enabling it and will miss my coworkers and teammates immensely.

But, now it's time to relax and move on to personal projects.

I'll post more soon about at least one of those personal projects!
