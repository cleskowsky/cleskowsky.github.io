* [We’re leaving Kubernetes](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/we-are-leaving-kubernetes): Remote development environments are something I tried and eventually came to the conclusion that they can easily become fairly wasteful of compute resources (cpu, ram, disk) and money. Lots of detail here around why it was hard in their context to get resource sharing right with workloads that were unpredictable.
* [Choosing the right Postgres indexes](https://incident.io/blog/choosing-the-right-postgres-indexes): Use indexes when:
  * You want to filter out rows you're not interested in
  * You want to sort returned rows
  * You want to guarantee uniqueness
* [The Problem with Using a UUID Primary Key in MySQL](https://planetscale.com/blog/the-problem-with-using-a-uuid-primary-key-in-mysql): UUIDs are bigger than ints in terms of storage and can be hard to sort in an index. (B+ tree balancing) Ints aren't always appropriate in terms of hiding information about a system though. Nanoids and other kinds of unique ids are talked about as well as several versions of uuids.
* [Go Turns 15](https://go.dev/blog/15years): Lovely little language that I wish I could use more in my day to day
* [Mission Control — Jobs](https://dev.37signals.com/mission-control-jobs/): A dashboard to see what a job queue system is working on right now with the ability to act on jobs like cancel them or retry. Minimal and easy to grok at a glance.
* [Navigating personal information with care](https://dev.37signals.com/navigating-personal-information-with-care/): How 37signals help desk handles investigations where a support person needs to look into an account at a level of detail that includes private data. The owner asking for help has to approve it and the action is added to an audit trail for review later by the security team.
* [Paper: Moral Crumple Zones](https://ferd.ca/notes/paper-moral-crumple-zones.html): Reminder that when bad things happen it's easy to blame the human involved even though they may not have had much agency or awareness of what was happening in the system because of where they sit (outside looking in) and what introspective tools are available to them.
* [Why Not Bluesky](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/11/15/Not-Bluesky): Tim is worried about the pressure that will be on Bluesky to find revenue after a round of VC money and a large team working on it. The fediverse is evolving more slowly but also doesn't have this pressure. Lots of people I used to follow on Twitter have gone to Bluesky in the last week or so.
