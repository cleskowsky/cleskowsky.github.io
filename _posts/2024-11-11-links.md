* [Weâ€™re leaving Kubernetes](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/we-are-leaving-kubernetes): Remote development environments are something I tried and eventually came to the conclusion that they can easily become fairly wasteful of compute resources (cpu, ram, disk) and money. Lots of detail here around why it was hard in their context to get resource sharing right with workloads that were unpredictable.
* [Choosing the right Postgres indexes](https://incident.io/blog/choosing-the-right-postgres-indexes): Use indexes when:
  * You want to filter out rows you're not interested in
  * You want to sort returned rows
  * You want to guarantee uniqueness
