* [Configure Liveness, Readiness and Startup Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/): K8s doc notes about how to think about liveness (when should a container be considered unhealthy and a candidate for restarts. Think about this one carefully since processes will be hard restarted) and readiness (when should requests be routed to a container) of a container
  * A general bit of guidance from the doc is that liveness and readiness probes can point at the same light-weight endpoint that does something meaningful but that liveness should be longer than readiness
  * Give an application enough time to stabilize after startup (it might need to hydrate data or configuration from another service)
  * Think about frequency of probes * max failures - these parameters should take into account how long an application takes to start up
