title:  "Weekly Notes 37: Caught up with a few videos on my playlist this week from !!Con, RailsWorld and JetBrains"
---

* [6 Steps to Authorization Mastery](https://laracasts.com/series/30-days-to-learn-laravel-11/episodes/23): Course video about how to do authorization in laravel 11. Love the simplicity of it. Trying to figure out how to do something similar in spring security but sadly haven't found the relevant documentation yet. :'(

* [Saving Voyager 1! - Bruce Waggoner at !!Con 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=dF_9YcehCZo&list=WL&index=10): Debugging and recovering a system that's millions of kilometers away with very little here in terms of simulators and testing and tools. Most of the people who knew about the project had retired or otherwise moved on. A single message-response cycle took 40hrs so any try at diagnosing and fixing took almost 2 days. I have no idea what this would have been like! :) Great story.
* [Rails World 2024 Opening Keynote - David Heinemeier Hansson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cEn_83zRFw): This conference was in Toronto this year. Nice looking venue. Another take on merchants of complexity idea which is resonating with me now. Rails 8 launched it sounds like.
* [Developing Spring Boot Applications With Joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvWtoaeHQUQ): IntellijIDEA is really powerful where one has to work with java code. Some neat stuff from this video:
  * RestAssured
  * DockerCompose spring boot plugin
  * TestContainers
  * JPA buddy
  * Various source code generators at different application layers (entity, data repository, service, controller, testing)
