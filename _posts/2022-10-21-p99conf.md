This is an online only conference where speakers prepare and record talks offline before they are shared with people in the conference and I guess there must be a community discord or slack server somewhere where people can talk about what they're seeing.

I've watched a couple videos so far. Both excellent!

* [Bryan Cantrill, Sharpening the Axe](https://www.p99conf.io/session/sharpening-the-axe-the-primacy-of-toolmaking/): Proposes the idea that toolmaking is not always seen as a valuable investment to be made as a company / team. It's an "investment in the future that takes away time and money from the now". He makes the point that we are where we are today in terms of tools like CI/CD, operating systems, debuggers, languages, etc because of people trying to scratch an itch that was hyper local to them and they were allowed to do so.
  * "Making tools is fundamentally human" We build tools that help us build better artifacts. This was a really great quote / idea!
