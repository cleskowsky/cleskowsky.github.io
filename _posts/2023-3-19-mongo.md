# Replication

* [Read preference defaults to primary unless the primary specifies otherwise](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.2/replication/#read-preference)
* [Mean time for a primary election is 12 seconds](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.2/replication/#automatic-failover)
* [Replication is an asynchronous process between primary and secondaries](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.2/core/replica-set-members/#secondaries)
* [Arbiters should be votes: 1, priority: 0 so they can never become primary but are able to participate in elections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.2/core/replica-set-members/#arbiter)
  * Not a desirable topology because a replset can come under pressure if you lose a data bearing node
* [Priority 0 members cannot become primary and cannot trigger elections](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.2/core/replica-set-priority-0-member/)
  * They can acknowledge writes for writeConcern: n
