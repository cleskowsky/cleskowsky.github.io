* [Uses this Adrian Hon](https://usesthis.com/interviews/adrian.hon/): Really like this one for whatever reason. :) Lots of cool gear I could see myself picking up one day.
* [Envelope encryption](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption): Store data securely using a data encryption key and key encryption key strategy.
* [JSON Web Token Right Answers](https://buttondown.email/illuminatedsecurity/archive/json-web-token-right-answers/): Guidance for constructing and securing jwts.
* [Paper: How in the World Did We Ever Get into That Mode?](https://ferd.ca/notes/paper-how-in-the-world-did-we-ever-get-into-that-mode.html): An analysis of automation and aircraft modes and the added cognitive load on pilots. They require the operator to know the current mode, all other available modes, and how to safely transition from one to the next when they're in the right context. Works somewhat ok when there is no stress but becomes much harder during an event. Think about how automation is design and system state is presented in a ui, training, more guardrails and just eliminating some modes altogether.
