* Tradeoff between system safety and some risk that allows you to take on new challenges
* Too much risk is not what we're talking about
* Being responsible
* Intention, awareness of new burden
* Should feel like you can push back against risk
* Needed within a team
  * Psychological safety, strong communication (share freely, communicate directly)
  * Good judgement
* Acceptance of failure
* "It's ok to call a dive if it doesn't feel safe"
* Alignment of risk tolerance - let the least experienced member of a group lead the team. Don't leave anyone behind. Let the person who might be the most uncomfortable in a situation decide whether we move forward or not.
* Experienced divers
  * Practice for failures (fire drills)
  * Prepare (pre-mortems, talk about plan, discuss when to fallback, align on risk tolerance, what are the goals)
  * Share your dive stories (post-mortems, output is not a list of jira tickets)
