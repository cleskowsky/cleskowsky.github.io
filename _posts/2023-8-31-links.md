title:  "Links: ritesh hindu Raksha Bandhan"

* [Raksha Bandhan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raksha_Bandhan): A ceremony in which a sister will tie a bracelet around a brother's wrist. It is a gesture of mutual protection between siblings.
* [Mundan ceremony](https://www.babycenter.in/a1015415/imundani-ceremony): Another Hindu ceremony in which a newborn child's hard is cut as a way to cleanse the body and soul. (Among other things.) Interesting!

Learned about a couple very interesting practices the other day from our new team member!
