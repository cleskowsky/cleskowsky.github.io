* [Avoiding the Top 10 NGINX Configuration Mistakes](https://www.nginx.com/blog/avoiding-top-10-nginx-configuration-mistakes/): I haven't used nginx in prod in a little while but I do like it a lot. Dependable little server with simple enough to grok config. I am guilty of the following: (Which is not to say I got into any trouble mind you)
  * Not creating an upstream block

* [Leadership, alignment](https://twitter.com/jmwind/status/1493569303030816770?s=12): A thread about strategy and alignment and about how you can get that by communicating with your leader.

* [The 5 Most Important HTTP Headers](https://alexzitowolf.medium.com/the-5-most-important-http-headers-d9e9f94bb1f6): Headers important to backend servers intended for api use or just serving resources over http generally
