* [A Commerce-centric Approach to Queuing Fairly at High Throughput](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3uUpEC_K78): Stateless vs stateful queuing approaches. Throttling first approach was stateless in the edge tier (nginx proxy with lua) and was a leaky / token bucket type algorithm. (Sliding window?) Nginx didn't have a global view of a rate limit per user so I guess each vm tracked a fraction of the overall limit? There was no notion of fairness. They added fairness to the system by giving each user an encrypted timestamp token that they polled with in a line. (For busy shops, customers past a threshold would automatically be directed to a polling queue page.)
  * There was also mention of control theory! which happens to be the book I am reading now recommended by Colm MacCarthaigh :)
