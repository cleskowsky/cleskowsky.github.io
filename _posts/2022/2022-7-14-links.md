  * Very readable
  * Useful !
* [Monitoring a tiny website by Julia Evans](https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/07/09/monitoring-small-web-services/): Not every system needs to be available 24/7 or page operators immediately when it goes down. A few things that can be done:

  * Create a simple health check endpoint that does a deep check
  * Restart services when you see a problem
