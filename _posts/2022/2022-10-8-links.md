* [Monktoberfest 2022](https://twitter.com/webchick/status/1578434911773474816): Great little conference with wonderful talks. Especially liked the one by Bryan Cantrill about letting kids be kids. The purpose of childhood is not necessarily knowledge accumulation but character development! Perseverence, kindness, teamwork, etc
