* [Brendan Gregg observability](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-05-23/what-is-observability.html): "Tools, data sources, methods of understanding how a system is operating."

* [Dropbox disaster recovery planning](https://dropbox.tech/infrastructure/disaster-readiness-test-failover-blackhole-sjc): Story of how dropbox came to their active-passive model of architecting services and how they test their system to make sure it can survive a full datacenter loss. Good stuff! It took years of planning, engineering and tries to get to where they are ...
* [Solving hard problems](https://praeclarum.org/2022/02/19/hard-problems.html): Sounds like pseudocode driven dev from code complete. Nice article about his process. I probably do something similar for harder things ... :)
