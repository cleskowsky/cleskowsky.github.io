* [Why Is It So Hard To Build Safe Software?](https://free-dissociation.com/blog/posts/2018/08/why-is-it-so-hard-to-build-safe-software/): Stuff to think about in here.
  * Pace of change
  * Number of people involved in practice
  * How much time is given to evaluate systems
  * Number of interacting systems
  * Physics of how close every system is to every other vs real world (There are no geographic constraints on the internet. Everyone is one mis-configuration away from everyone else.)
* [An introduction to approachable threat modeling](https://increment.com/security/approachable-threat-modeling/): A personal favourite of mine. Presented in this article is a way to think about threat modelling of a system that is straightforward and doesn't add a lot of overhead that is avoided.
  * Principles, (who is interested in this system being up)
  * Goals, (What do we want the system to be able to do, within what constraints)
  * Adversities, (What could happen that would interfere with our goals)
  * Invariants (What should also be true in the system to ensure applied workloads make progress)
