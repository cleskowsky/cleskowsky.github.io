* [Notes on building debugging puzzles](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/04/16/notes-on-debugging-puzzles/): Great writeup of the thinking that went into how the game was designed to be satisfying as well as instructive and challenging without being brutal. (The satisfying part!) Just so thoughtful. I love it. Here are a few of the choices:
	* 1 bug per game
	* Real command output displayed
	* Learned knowledge through a scenario is presented in a sidebar
	* The player always wins (ie Figures out the bug)
	* Used free form textboxes so players could type what they think (rather than using rigid multi-select type boxes)
	* Short, 5m tops to finish a scenario
	* etc
