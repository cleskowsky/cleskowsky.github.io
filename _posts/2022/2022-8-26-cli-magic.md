So I found this video on twitter the other day (Shared by Jess Archer?) and wow is it ever an example of great flexibility and tasteful ux around CLI tooling. It's not a long one but there's a gorgeous data pipeline setup between a github pr fetcher, a fuzzy finder, awk and finally xargs.

* Github cli
* fzf
* awk
* xargs
* Plus lots of behaviour modifying arguments !! :)
