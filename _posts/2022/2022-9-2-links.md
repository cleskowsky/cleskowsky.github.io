* [Slack's build system as a service](https://slack.engineering/buildrock-a-build-platform-at-slack/): A story about how slack went from many different jenkins clusters run by different teams in the company to a service where teams can still run independent jenkins clusters but those jenkins clusters are build in a consistent way using a ConfigAsCode plugin, docker and k8s for running build agents. A shared k8s cluster is used to house the various different jenkins clusters. Very nice! I'll have to take a look at the casc plugin for work!
