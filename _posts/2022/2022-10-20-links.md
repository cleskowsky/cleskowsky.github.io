title:  "Links Ryan singer on ui design, DHH on leaving the cloud to save big on costs"

Bit of a 37signals day thus far ... :)

* [Ryan Singer on his ui design process (outcomes oriented)](https://twitter.com/rjs/status/1581551135554297857): That was an excellent Play by Play series!
* [DHH on leaving the cloud and running their own servers](https://world.hey.com/dhh/why-we-re-leaving-the-cloud-654b47e0): Not the first company to reach a scale where somebody looks at the cloud provider bill and asks "That's a big bill. Can we run these servers ourselves?"
