* [Neil Gaiman followed around at NYCC](https://twitter.com/PrimeVideo/status/1579978084224184320?s=20&t=ar7FO75glErOa6nkdMC9ug): Nice short video of a day in the life of Neil while he was visiting NYC comiccon ... recently? He was doing a panel where people were talking about Good Omens 2. The first series was so good!
