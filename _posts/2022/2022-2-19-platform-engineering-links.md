title: "Platform engineering links"

I found an amazing thread the other day about a concern that sits between operations / sre and product engineers. Platform engineering. (Developer experience, platform, tools?) I have a bit of reading to do! :) This stuff is super interesting to me!

  * Full cycle developers in the netflix sense
  * Push responsibility of owning / running prod left towards developers
  * Kubernetes shop from early days (2017ish)
  * Developers don't get direct access to production but they have a gitops like workflow with pull requests, reviews for changes, multiple eyes on deck before acceptance
  * There is a team that is focused on the boundary between devs and the platform - documentation, onboarding, examples, tech talks, learning + improvement
    * They provide real world examples of how their teams solved specific problems using their platform tools
    * They have a golden path base project to encourage people to start with a known stack but allow teams to choose their own tools
    * They consider tool sprawl a problem? (Seems like a conflict with former)
  * They started with rails, ported to nodejs and are now running golang :/
