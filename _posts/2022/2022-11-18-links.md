* [Hachyderm Infrastructure](https://medium.com/@kris-nova/hachyderm-infrastructure-74f518bc7472): Love posts like this. It's a straightforward webapp hosting solution that is getting a lot of data from many people who have left twitter and are looking for their next community. Mastodon servers can be hosted by one's self or you can join a larger community hosted by volunteers which is what hachyderm is. I'm here right now as well and it's great. Not in the way twitter was - they're different - but still very much great. :)
