# Big ideas

* SLOs should be customer focused!
  * Eg Loading the home page is fast
  * It's nice to be able to tell how individual customers are doing vs system-level aggregate metrics
* Tradeoff between reliability work vs product work based on agreement between stakeholders about how important a service is thought to be
  * slo is set based on this

# Todos

* Read about burn rates in the google sre book

# Notes

* [SLOs for the new dog owner](https://youtu.be/UkeDTG8CdKA)
    * Objectives were set for a timid little new friend
    * Bit of an iterative process ... had to start small and be realistic given where Misha was (couldn't do what owner ultimately wanted just yet)
    * Had to be a bit comfortable with a starting baseline that included some freak out moments (punching through the set SLO). So alert threshold set higher than the ideal
    * Setup a plan to improve the baseline in small increments
    * Had to step back from experiments along the way because Misha wasn't ready for the step size
    * Some SLOs are temporary
    * Sometimes SLOs change over time as the system changes
    * Speaker: Isobel Redelmeier, SRE @ Dischord

* [Evaluating SLOs at scale](https://youtu.be/YsZAcQJ2rD0)
    * SLOs are customer focused, eg
        * Home page loads quickly
        * Customer data ingests quickly
        * User run queries are fast
    * Talked about a couple of different re-architecture decisions that help them deal with fast scaling
    * Sometimes you make a choice that helps you today but has a not-long shelf life (eg 6 or 12 months) while you work on a longer term fix
    * Short term fixes are often fine. Building for system size too far out can be waste
    * Speaker: Liz-Fong Jones, Dev Advocate @ Honeycomb

* [Reliability lessons from the back of a bicycle](https://youtu.be/QhQObHHecl4)
  * Good slis are specific and can be evalated for an event with a simple true / false type answer
    * eg All trips 5 miles or less from their home should be made on a bicycle
    * eg slo For above is 80% of trips in the last 7 days were made on a bicycle
  * Good slos are attainanble / achievable. There comfortably within the realm of the possible
  * You shouldn't have a lot of slos. A few is usually enough for the system
  * This was a fun talk that started with covid and a desire to limit the carbon footprint of their household
  * Michael Ericksen @ Intelligent Medical Objects
  * I'm pretty sure I've heard this fellow speak before. I like him muchly :)

* [Customer centric slos](https://youtu.be/gCBM6ur8atI)
  * System wide slos hide how customers are actually experiencing your system
    * aggregates
    * can look fine when there are customers in pain
  * Had customer facing slos similar to honeycomb's as described by Liz
    * Fast ingest (within a minute)
    * No metrics / logs dropped
    * Collectors able to register quickly
    * Responsiveness of the ui and querying
  * Every week they get together and look at the 10 customers with the worst experience on the platform and think about how things can be improved for them
  * Stefan Zier @ Sumo logic

* [SLOs for everyone](https://youtu.be/0o3tR0d3gUw)
  * If you're measuring your customer experience and trying to make that better you're basically doing slos
  * He comes from a service industry background (restaurant server I think) and relates that lack or not of customer happiness to how well the business is doing
  * Told a story about a time where the different roles in the restaurant (service, kitchen, bussing, etc) stopped working together well and how that impacted the overall customer experience
  * Alex Hidalgo @ Nobl9

* [How to answer tricky questions the sre way](https://youtu.be/b2YTHzD1EiA)
  * An slo is an agreement among stakeholders about the availability / reliability needed for a service
  * Jakub Warczarek @ ?

* [Ensuring reliability with burn rates](https://youtu.be/5OcTdS-LcbA)
  * I need to review my burn rate math :)
  * There's apparently more on this topic in the google sre book
  * When do you alert when you're working with error budgets? Static thresholds? Maybe there's something like that in there somewhere but it seems like burn rates are really interesting
  * Want to know when the error rate in the system is going to put you at risk of burning through your error budget inside a rolling slo calc window
  * 2 kinds
    * long 5-7 hours looks for long, slow burns in recent time that will eventually knock you our of your error budget tolerance
    * short 5 minutes for really fast drop-offs in what is considered good service by users
  * Ajuna Kyaruzi @ Datadog
