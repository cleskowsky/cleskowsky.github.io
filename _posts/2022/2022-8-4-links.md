* [Google cloud incident report](https://status.cloud.google.com/incidents/vLsxuKoRvykNHW3nnhsJ): Bad network config rolled out. The team was able to pause a phased global rollout but there was widespread impact because automation will efficiently apply any migration you ask it to. :) They rolled back. Remidiation steps are better monitoring and dashboards to more quickly identify this issue going forward. (Network service degredation.)
