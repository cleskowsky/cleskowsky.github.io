* [Server side event](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events): Long polling clients make sense in some contexts. (eg Real-time chat apps) This seems like a reasonable way to go about that. I guess it requires state to be preserved about open connections at least on the client and server sides. Unsure about network components in between?
* [The state of HTTP in 2022](https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-state-of-http-in-2022/): Quite the list of changes to http in the last year or so. Incredible. I never thought of http as being as alive and moving as much as it is. I guess http3/quic was a big change. :) Oblivious http and other privacy / security related changes sounded neat among other things. So much here!
