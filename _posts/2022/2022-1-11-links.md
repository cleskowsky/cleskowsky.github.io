* [Designing whatsapp](http://highscalability.com/blog/2022/1/3/designing-whatsapp.html): Loved this post. It's a bit more complex than I think it maybe has to be (not sure why the split between the chatserver and transientserver thing) but not much. Also like how the requirements are well defined at the beginning. Capacity planning, end-2-end security come in as well!
