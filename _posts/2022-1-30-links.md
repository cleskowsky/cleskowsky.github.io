* [JEvans on esbuild](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/11/15/esbuild-vue/): Lots of interesting things in here. Tradeoffs between simple and complex frameworks. Simple is nice because there's a better chance you'll be able to understand most things in a project. Complicated may be needed for bigger projects but maybe not!
    * Notes on import vs require were interesting
        * Import is: safer (restricted), used on the frontend more, asynchronous, related to es6 modules somehow, can be executed by browsers (browsers can do require)
        * Require seems to be more a backend thing, commonjs module style?
