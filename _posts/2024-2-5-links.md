title:  "Week 6: cloudflare security incident, scalability marc brooker, load testing performance"
---

* [Thanksgiving 2023 security incident](https://blog.cloudflare.com/thanksgiving-2023-security-incident): More fallout from an okta security incident last year.
* [What is Scalability Anyway?](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/01/18/scalability.html): A measure of how incremental increase in applied workload to a system affects resource utilization / required infra to handle it. Many workloads need more infra at the start of process (bootstrap os, program, etc) and then need a constant, predictable amount thereafter. Interesting that serverless avoids the initial bump but you pay more throughout the entire lifetime.
* [API load testing: A beginner's guide](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/01/30/api-load-testing/?ck_subscriber_id=185275687): Guide to doing load testing by grafana that talks about how to start and what to keep in mind. Good high level overview.
