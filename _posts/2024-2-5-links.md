title:  "Week 6: cloudflare security incident, scalability marc brooker"

* [Thanksgiving 2023 security incident](https://blog.cloudflare.com/thanksgiving-2023-security-incident): More fallout from an okta security incident last year.
* [What is Scalability Anyway?](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/01/18/scalability.html): A measure of how incremental increase in applied workload to a system affects resource utilization / required infra to handle it. Many workloads need more infra at the start of process (bootstrap os, program, etc) and then need a constant, predictable amount thereafter. Interesting that serverless avoids the initial bump but you pay more throughout the entire lifetime.
