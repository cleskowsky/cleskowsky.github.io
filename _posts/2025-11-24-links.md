* [P99 CONF 2025 Rethinking Durable Workflows and Queues: A Library-based Approach by Qian Li](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xl7kmXVE7vs): Using a library in process and an existing database for persistent job state during a batch process can be quicker and simpler to reason about compared with externalized state to something like redis or other message queue. (She compares to step functions) Sounds very much like spring batch and queueing systems in other full stack frameworks like laravel. Also considered for batch processing are failed workers, checkpoints, and step skips. Very nice. :)
