* [The Evolution of Garbage Collectors: From Javaâ€™s CMS to ZGC, and a JVM vs Go vs Rust Latency Shootout](https://codemia.io/blog/path/The-Evolution-of-Garbage-Collectors-From-Javas-CMS-to-ZGC-and-a-JVM-vs-Go-vs-Rust-Latency-Shootout): Modern garbage collectors are great. Stopping threads at safepoints during a gc don't seem to introduce any latency and go / java / rust aren't that far away from eachother (Note rust doesn't have gc. You have think about memory allocator config up front maybe? and memory is reference counted / freed as necessary)
* [Astronomical probability of UUIDv4 collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Collisions): Uuidv4 are unlikely
* [Omicron Database Design](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0192): Oxide describes choices they made in their db design. Stuff for me to think about:
  * No foreign keys for performance?
  * Scalability def: add a server to increase capacity, little or no sensitivity to size of collection
  * Db transaction: a group of statements that together should share acid properties
* [What is the use of ProxyPassReverse Directive](https://serverfault.com/questions/774041/what-is-the-use-of-proxypassreverse-directive): Makes sense. Spending a bit of time thinking about httpd configuration these last few days ... sigh :)

# A comment in apache httpd's source code, mod_proxy_http.c

```
    /* RFC2616 tells us to forward this.
     *
     * OTOH, an interim response here may mean the backend
     * is playing sillybuggers.  The Client didn't ask for
     * it within the defined HTTP/1.1 mechanisms, and if
     * it's an extension, it may also be unsupported by us.
     *
     * There's also the possibility that changing existing
     * behaviour here might break something.
     *
     * So let's make it configurable.
     *
     * We need to force "r->expecting_100 = 1" for RFC behaviour
     * otherwise ap_send_interim_response() does nothing when
     * the client did not ask for 100-continue.
     *
     * 101 Switching Protocol has its own configuration which
     * shouldn't be interfered by "proxy-interim-response".
