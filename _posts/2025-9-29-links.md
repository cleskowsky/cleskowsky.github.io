* [The Evolution of Garbage Collectors: From Javaâ€™s CMS to ZGC, and a JVM vs Go vs Rust Latency Shootout](https://codemia.io/blog/path/The-Evolution-of-Garbage-Collectors-From-Javas-CMS-to-ZGC-and-a-JVM-vs-Go-vs-Rust-Latency-Shootout): Modern garbage collectors are great. Stopping threads at safepoints during a gc don't seem to introduce any latency and go / java / rust aren't that far away from eachother (Note rust doesn't have gc. You have think about memory allocator config up front maybe? and memory is reference counted / freed as necessary)
* [Astronomical probability of UUIDv4 collision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Collisions): Uuidv4 are unlikely
* [Omicron Database Design](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0192): Oxide describes choices they made in their db design. Stuff for me to think about:
  * No foreign keys for performance?
  * Scalability def: add a server to increase capacity, little or no sensitivity to size of collection
  * Db transaction: a group of statements that together should share acid properties
