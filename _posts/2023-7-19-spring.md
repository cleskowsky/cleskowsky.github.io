# Code

* [activitypub](https://github.com/cleskowsky/activitypub): A side project where I write a small-ish mastadon server using spring boot and learn hopefully some things along the way including how to organize behaviour, and how to instrument in a way that makes understanding how my program works in production is at least possible.

* [Practical Use of Spring Batch and Spring Integration](https://spring.io/blog/2010/02/15/practical-use-of-spring-batch-and-spring-integration): It seems like there can be a bit of overlap between spring integration and batch. I'm thinking about where to use vs the other now.
* [Handling exceptions in spring mvc](https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc): Write an exception and tag it with an annotation include status and error message. This is pretty damn elegant. If you can figure the magic! :)
