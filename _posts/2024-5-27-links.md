title:  "Week 22: tcp nodelay linux networking, aws bedrock ai audio summary, okta architecture documentation, jenkins casc ansible"
---

* [Itâ€™s always TCP_NODELAY. Every damn time](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/05/09/nagle.html): Interesting low level kernel networking behaviour that can cause trouble to distributed systems builders. (I kind of am I guess and so is anyone who has to operate more than a single process.) I do believe I work at a layer above where this becomes an issue though? At least I don't believe I've ever seen strange latencies in the work I do.
* [Hacking our way to better team meetings](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/05/hacking-our-way-to-better-team-meetings.html): Tiny app doing summarization of an audio file on aws with bedrock.
* [How we do Architecture at Okta - Monica Bajaj, VP Engineering & Mark Voelker, VP Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asoVNjGoFOM): Talks about leveling up tech and people. Architects are hands-on. Big emphasis on sharing knowledge and learning and they do that by writing everything they do down.

* [geerlingguy ansible-role-jenkins](https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-role-jenkins/tree/master): An ansible role that configures a jenkins server. Plugin management isn't something that the casc plugin can do by default for whatever reason. Jeff has figured out a way using a jenkins provived cli tool (api client) and api. Neat.
* [jenkins plugin Configuration as Code](https://plugins.jenkins.io/configuration-as-code/): Since I mentioned casc above, here's a link. Casc is able to manage tools, the jenkins server environment, credentials, and likely a few more things I haven't gotten into yet.
