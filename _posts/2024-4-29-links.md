* [How we sort of automate updating system packages across our Ubuntu machines](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/UbuntuOurUpdateSystem): This sounds very similar to what we're currently doing at work. It's manual with tooling to help analyze the work to do and report on work done.
* [AI Image Feedback Loop](https://kottke.org/24/04/ai-image-feedback-loop): Neat bit of artwork that came out of a loop between midjourney and chatgpt.
