I got a bit of reading in over the holidays despite being in Antarctica! We had Starlink on the ship. :)

* [Mastodon thread about a monolith app architecture vs microservices](https://mastodon.social/@tef/111662168788164065): Haven't gotten tired of reading these yet. Turns out it depends is the answer to whether you should. Complexity in the system goes up and the operational overhead too. Make sure it'll actually make everyone's life easier.
* [What is this thing called Profiling?](http://hirt.se/blog/?p=1435): Java flight recorder is designed to be a low overhead monitoring tool for java programs. Target is in the 1% or less overhead range which is usually as much as you'd ever allow in prod. Reading a book called Understanding Software Dynamics now which is all about this stuff.
* [On Premises with DHH](https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/1737902387774537823): An amazing conversation about where we came from as technologists (not ancient history - only the last 10-15 yrs or so) and where we are today in terms of choosing the platforms we run on. On-prem makes a bunch of sense for lots of use cases and contexts. Cloud hosting does too but there's a big cost to it and a loss of ... self-determination? in some ways. Another topic near and dear to my heart is the explosive growth in complexity of our systems and the recent desirability of this kind of inertia. Sigh. :)
* [Inside Mark Zuckerberg’s Top-Secret Hawaii Compound](https://www.wired.com/story/mark-zuckerberg-inside-hawaii-compound/): Wow.

> In his book, Rushkoff criticizes what he calls “the mindset”—a belief that “with enough money and technology, wealthy men can live as gods and transcend the calamities that befall everyone else.” In doing so, he writes, they apply the same exit strategy of Silicon Valley startups to civilization itself.

> “If anybody has enough money to insulate himself from the damage created for society, it would be Zuck,” says Rushkoff. “That’s sort of what it is. He’s destroyed the government and society, and now he can go to Hawaii and build a fort.”

* [Examples of Great URL Design](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/examples-of-great-urls/): I think there is an art to good url design too. A few neat examples in here.
* [HOW STANDARD EBOOKS SERVES MILLIONS OF REQUESTS PER MONTH WITH A 2GB VPS; OR, A PAEAN TO THE CLASSIC WEB](https://alexcabal.com/posts/standard-ebooks-and-classic-web-tech): Html, css and vanilla js can take you a long way these days and not using heavy frameworks makes for a much simpler website to maintain and run
* [JEP 248: Make G1 the Default Garbage Collector](https://openjdk.org/jeps/248): G1 is the default java garbage collector at of java9. It was deemed ready to be default as of java8 release 40. Considering switching to this at work as an alternative to the parallel collector we're currently using which has starting stalling on us for 0.5-1s at a time at this point for stop the world portions of full gc runs.
* [How to choose the best Java garbage collector](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/11/02/how-choose-best-java-garbage-collector#): Guidance from redhat about how to choose a gc algorithm (strategy?)
* [Antarctica & Falkland Expedition](https://www.hurtigruten.com/en-us/expeditions/cruises/antarctica-falklands-expedition/): Itinerary for our Antarctica trip December 2023
