* [Bruno Prieto - Making accessible web apps with Rails and Hotwire - Rails World 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK2wApjyswM): A seeing impaired developer talks about how to make websites more accessible.

# Sample github workflow for solid queue

* runs on push to repository and pull_request
* 2 stages: linting, units
* neat healthCheck for mysql
* neat setup of build context (2 dbs + a running app somewhere)
* small number of test stage steps
* very readable
* [github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rails/solid_queue/refs/heads/main/.github/workflows/main.yml)
