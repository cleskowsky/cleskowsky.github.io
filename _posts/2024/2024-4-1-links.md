title:  "Week 14: srecon, uuids, geerlingguy raspberrypi, letsencrypt cloudflare"
---

* [SREcon24 Americas Recap](https://willgallego.com/2024/03/24/srecon24-americas-recap/): There's a handful of recommended talks in here that all seem like good ones to watch.
* [Thoughtworks Technology Radar April 2024](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar): Always love going through these radar publications and learning about what the various teams at thoughtworks are leaning into in terms of tooling. This time there is:
  * Rancher desktop
  * Bruno
  * Infrastructure orchestration platforms, and
  * Podman
* [The ULTIMATE Raspberry Pi 5 NAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l30sADfDiM8): Raspberry pi 5 home nas experiment by geerlingguy with 4 ssds. Cost came out to about $150 usd I think for the enclosure not including disks. That's a bit cheaper than others but you have to assembla the kit yourself (very diy) and you own all the h/w and s/w in the device. Lately I've been using my mac mini with external drives attached as a file / media server.
* [The UX of UUIDs](https://unkey.dev/blog/uuid-ux): How to make uuids easier to work with and think about when you see them in code and systems.
* [How we ensure Cloudflare customers aren't affected by Let's Encrypt's certificate chain change](https://blog.cloudflare.com/shortening-lets-encrypt-change-of-trust-no-impact-to-cloudflare-customers): Let's encrypt root cert expiry and cloudflare's decision to stop using le to sign new certificates.
* [Unit Tests Considered Harmful](https://www.shaiyallin.com/post/unit-tests-considered-harmful): These days I feel like integration testing (without mocks and stubs) probably gets me the most bang for energy I put into testing. e2e testing is great too but hard. Units also have their place. The testing trophy is mightier than the pyramid ... :)
