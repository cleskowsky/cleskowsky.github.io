I use Jenkins at work and would like a place to write down random learnings about how to run it well ... -ish :) ... whether they're hard won by me or from someone else on the interwebs.

Note: There are several very good continuous integration programs out there these days and I find that learning how one of them works is a good starter for reasoning about others. ymmv

* We create 2 pipelines per project - build, deploy. These are physical files in the project filesystem.
* Pipelines often have 4 stages - code, build, test, deploy.
  * **Code** checkouts out from version control.
  * **Build** runs make or another build script and unit tests and generates a test coverage report.
  * **Test** deploys a new build to a staging environment and runs a suite of automated e2e tests.
  * **Deploy** promotes a new build from staging to production.
* Jenkins automation
  * Casc
    * Env vars
  * JobDsl
* Having a local develop environment for pipeline and shared library testing is life altering.
