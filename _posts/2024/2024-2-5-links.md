* [Thanksgiving 2023 security incident](https://blog.cloudflare.com/thanksgiving-2023-security-incident): More fallout from an okta security incident last year.
* [What is Scalability Anyway?](http://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/01/18/scalability.html): A measure of how incremental increase in applied workload to a system affects resource utilization / required infra to handle it. Many workloads need more infra at the start of process (bootstrap os, program, etc) and then need a constant, predictable amount thereafter. Interesting that serverless avoids the initial bump but you pay more throughout the entire lifetime.
* [API load testing: A beginner's guide](https://grafana.com/blog/2024/01/30/api-load-testing/?ck_subscriber_id=185275687): Guide to doing load testing by grafana that talks about how to start and what to keep in mind. Good high level overview.
* [Lessons From Our 8 Years Of Kubernetes In Production](https://medium.com/@.anders/learnings-from-our-8-years-of-kubernetes-in-production-two-major-cluster-crashes-ditching-self-0257c09d36cd): K8s is a complex system that's hard to run. A platform was built around it before it was well understood / ready for broad use. A lot of operations energy will be spent understanding it and keeping it up to date. Sounds fantastic!
* [Indicators of Compromise (IOC) Security](https://www.crowdstrike.com/cybersecurity-101/indicators-of-compromise/): Talks about some of the things you can look at to be able to tell a server has been breached. (eg Anomalous network activity)
* [Get started with JDK Flight Recorder in OpenJDK 8u](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2020/08/25/get-started-with-jdk-flight-recorder-in-openjdk-8u): Low overhead tracing / profiling framework for java backported to version 8. The aim is to introduce <1% overhead during a profile so it's suitable to run in production. Analyzing data dumps collected is also nice with java mission control.
* [Notes on using a single-person Mastodon server](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/08/11/some-notes-on-mastodon/): Notes about what the fediverse is like and about running on a server of one.
* [Logging at scale with canonical log lines](https://baselime.io/blog/canonical-log-lines): Arbitrarily wide log events, one log event per request, and machine-readable log events are good ideas I think.
* [Oxide computer docs](https://docs.oxide.computer/cli/guides/introduction): Beautiful developer and operator documentation for a new datacenter computer.
* [Canon TDD](https://tidyfirst.substack.com/p/canon-tdd): Kent Beck describes the flow of building software in a test first way.
