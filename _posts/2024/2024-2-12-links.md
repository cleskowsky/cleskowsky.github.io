* [Getting Big Things Done](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/10/19/big-changes.html): Our ability to take on bigger projects necessarily involves working together with others, understanding different points of view and meeting people where they are.
* [A guide to running Incident Command](https://argoday.medium.com/incident-command-guide-9872b51d7c94): What an incident commander should do. Reminder that the commander should not be trying to investigate / fix the problem. There is an orchestrating role that is important to a smooth response team.
* [How to conduct a postmortem review meeting](https://argoday.medium.com/how-to-conduct-a-postmortem-review-meeting-8cb5d2d2b303): Nice overview of how to prepare and run the post incident review meeting. Prepare the timeline doc ahead of time, schedule enough time for the meetup, it's nice for a manager to run it to represent the team. Bunch of other good thoughts in here.
* [(Almost) Every infrastructure decision I endorse or regret after 4 years running infrastructure at a startup](https://cep.dev/posts/every-infrastructure-decision-i-endorse-or-regret-after-4-years-running-infrastructure-at-a-startup/): Some thoughtful commentary on tools that helped and those that didn't end up adding much value to how the team worked.
* [My Sixth Year as a Bootstrapped Founder](https://mtlynch.io/solo-developer-year-6/): A founder talks about his 6th year running a business. Even so far as to talk about where the money came and went as well. Enjoyed this one.
* [Uses this: Anthony Agius](https://usesthis.com/interviews/decryption/): Liked this one. Daily newsletter writer, and does managed discourse hosting on the side. Make.com looks like a cool tool!
* [A Guide to the Go Garbage Collector](https://tip.golang.org/doc/gc-guide): Spending time thinking about gc lately in java and stop the world pauses. Go's collector is a bit different and simpler but the ideas cross over well enough.
