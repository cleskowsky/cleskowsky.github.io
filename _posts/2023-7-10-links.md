* [Devtools time: Liz Fong Jones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlR9jdj0sa4&list=PL6zLuuRVa1_iDEP4EicZ8972RgyccCRGF&index=10): Liz Fong Jones walks us through her development setup @ home, tools, process and lots of other things. This was great. It is a video in a series of similar ones. Many of them equally great! :)
