* [Multi tenant behaviour provided by hibernate](https://spring.io/blog/2022/07/31/how-to-integrate-hibernates-multitenant-feature-with-spring-data-jpa-in-a-spring-boot-application): Short example of how to do multi tenancy in a spring application using hibernate.
* [Google java code style](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html): I like this style. There's a code formatter that conforms to this style as well that can be used as part of a build process.
