title:  "Week 10: e2e testing prototyping, otel open telemetry collector, slo sli"
---

* [Permanent Prototypes](https://www.shaiyallin.com/post/permanent-prototypes): It's true that code you thought wasn't going to live for long because you were just trying something out can and often does. I'm also coming around to the idea that e2e tests are very important because this is where you validate that your app still works!
* [Titles for Ops](https://basecamp.com/handbook/titles-for-ops): 37signals shares levels for members of their operations team. The degree to which a team member is able to work autonimously with trust is interest. Also how well somebody is able to point us in the direction we should go and get us there.
* [Alerting on the User Experience](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/alerting-on-user-experience): I like the end 2 end test they use as a strong signal for system health. Interesting discussion of who to page if multiple teams are responsible for the system being up.
* [Touching Grass With SLOs](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/honeycomb-internal-slos): "Figure out what your customers care about and measure that." eg Low latency for websites, orders can be placed in < 30s, etc. Nice sli / slo ideas.
* [OpenTelemetry Collector Anti-Patterns](https://dev.to/avillela/opentelemetry-collector-anti-patterns-42be?ck_subscriber_id=185275687): Where, when and why to use the open telemetry collector.
* [HandlerInterceptors vs. Filters in Spring MVC](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-handlerinterceptor-vs-filter): Filters are part of the servlet spec not spring. They're hit before a request is passed into spring's dispatcher by tomcat. Interceptors sit between the spring dispatcher and target controller that will process the request.
* [WELL's OceanMD Experiences Significant User Growth and Announces Upcoming Launch of New 'Health Messenger' to Help Care Providers Communicate Securely and Efficiently](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/well-s-oceanmd-experiences-significant-user-growth-and-announces-upcoming-launch-of-new-health-messenger-to-help-care-providers-communicate-securely-and-efficiently-891854485.html): WELL Health and OceanMD are growing in use in Canada.
