title:  "Week 10: e2e testing prototyping"
---

* [Permanent Prototypes](https://www.shaiyallin.com/post/permanent-prototypes): It's true that code you thought wasn't going to live for long because you were just trying something out can and often does. I'm also coming around to the idea that e2e tests are very important because this is where you validate that your app still works!
* [Titles for Ops](https://basecamp.com/handbook/titles-for-ops): 37signals shares levels for members of their operations team. The degree to which a team member is able to work autonimously with trust is interest. Also how well somebody is able to point us in the direction we should go and get us there.
* [Alerting on the User Experience](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/alerting-on-user-experience): I like the end 2 end test they use as a strong signal for system health. Interesting discussion of who to page if multiple teams are responsible for the system being up.
