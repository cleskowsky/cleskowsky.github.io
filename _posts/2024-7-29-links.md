* [How we sort of automate updating system packages across our Ubuntu machines](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/linux/UbuntuOurUpdateSystem): A process to keep o/s patches up to date across many servers. I like that there is a manual component to it. The automation is there to service the operator not replace them.
* [MongoDB Tuning Anti-Patterns: How Tuning Memory Can Make Things Much Worse](https://www.percona.com/blog/mongodb-tuning-anti-patterns-how-tuning-memory-can-make-things-much-worse/): Interesting point about compressed vs uncompressed data and how mongo balances that. 50% ram usage by mongo is fine nearly always!
* [The power of two random choices, visualized](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Feb/6/the-power-of-two-random-choices-visualized/): Easy to see 2 random choices load balancing strategy is better than random choice.
* [A write-ahead log is not a universal part of durability](https://notes.eatonphil.com/2024-07-01-a-write-ahead-log-is-not-a-universal-part-of-durability.html): Durability, performance and the write ahead log. (WAL) Simple code snippets help get the ideas across effectively.
* [Linux Crisis Tools](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog//2024-03-24/linux-crisis-tools.html): List of tools that may be used when investigating a performance issue on a linux server. (Ubuntu)

* [Curl secure development practices](https://mastodon.social/@bagder/112883554531535768): Nice list of this the curl team members do to try to lower the risk of security concerns in their process.
* [What Is an Instruction Set Architecture?](https://www.arm.com/glossary/isa): Came up in an interview with the framework laptop ceo. The interface between h/w and s/w in a computer. Defines the operations and data types and operating system can send to the processor.
