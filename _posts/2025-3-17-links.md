* [HTTP/3 is everywhere but nowhere](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/http3-quic-open-source-support-nowhere/?utm_source=tldrwebdev): Hyperscalers and browsers can do http3 but not a lot of open source servers have the protocol built in. There are also differences of opinion about how to proceed which has slowed down adoption.
* [HTTP vs. HTTP/2 vs. HTTP/3: Whatâ€™s the Difference?](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/http-vs-http-2-vs-http-3-whats-the-difference/): Guide detailing advances in later http protocol versions.

* [7 Best Practices of File Upload With JavaScript](https://storagebowl.net/blogs/best-practices-of-file-upload?utm_source=tldrwebdev): Nice list of things to consider for improving file uploads.
