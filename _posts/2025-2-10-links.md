* [Paper: Fuck Nuance](https://ferd.ca/notes/paper-fuck-nuance.html): Simpler models can be more broadly applicable than detailed special purpose ones.
* [Build a link blog](https://xuanwo.io/links/2025/01/link-blog/): Kinda what I'm doing here with my links posts. Read something and then write about it. (Usually falls under summary + personal anecdotes for me!)
* [Youâ€™re missing your near misses](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/02/01/youre-missing-your-near-misses/): We don't often create opportunities to run nearly failed situations through our standard incident response process because it's never triggered and there's a cost to incidents that can be quite high in terms of energy and time. But there is stuff to be learned here ... Is there a way to do that more reasonably?
* [DSQL Vignette: Reads and Compute](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/12/04/inside-dsql.html): Amazon DSQL and reads. Compute is scalable, uses lambda (postgres embedded container), and separate from storage. Neat stuff!
