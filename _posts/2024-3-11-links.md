* [eBPF: Unlocking the Kernel [OFFICIAL DOCUMENTARY]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb_vD3XZYOA): Nicely done documentary describing how this project came about. So much impact.
* [SRE Archetypes](https://blog.alexewerlof.com/p/sre-archetypes): I appreciate the buckets that the author comes up with for themes in the work we often take on in SRE / Ops / DevOps.
* [Loki storage](https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/storage/): S3 backed log storage + grafana as a frontend for analysis. Sweet!
