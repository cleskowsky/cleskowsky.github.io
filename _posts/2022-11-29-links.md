* [Protect Me From What I Want](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2022/11/28/On-Algorithms): No algorithm isn't an option because even just giving you a list of your most recent statuses is an algorithm choice. What do you do with a status that was boosted several time by people you follow ... do you show duplicates? Answering yes / no to this is an algorithmic choice. Finishes with food for though: Can we come up with an algorithm that isn't made by somebody trying to sell you something or influence your thinking for personal gain? Can we make an altruistic algorithm?
* [Spring boot + htmx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=38WAVRfxPxI): 30m video shows a tiny todo app that uses bootstrap, spring boot and htmx which is a library you can use to markup frontend code in the backend to add behaviour that would traditionally be implemented with javascript.
