* [Egoless Engineering](https://egoless.engineering/): Great ideas here:
  * A task (frontend, backend, ops, security, etc) does not equate to a role
  * Senior people don't own, they teach
  * Isolating a team from certain kinds of work isn't sustainable nor does it always produce the best outcomes (eg dev from ops, security)
  * Let them deploy and build safety nets and gaurdrails (tests, promotion process, feature flags, etc)
* [How Programming Changed](https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/12/9/tech-2025/#how-programming-changed): "70% of my lines of code is now written by Claude Code" :/
