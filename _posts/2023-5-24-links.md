* [TLS, byte by byte](https://subtls.pages.dev/): Fantastic hands-on guide to how the tls handshake works + post handshake activities like actually downloading the webpage you tried to fetch. :)
* [Mongodb log messages](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/log-messages/#std-label-log-message-json-output-format): Mongodb switches to structured logging as of 4.4
* [Remembering the important bits to log](https://letsbuild.cloud/2023/05/18/important-logs.html): Nice acronym for thinking about things to log - REDIT:
  * Capture **r**equest / response info
  * Capture **e**rrors
  * Capture calls to external **d**ependencies
  * Capture details about **i**mportant business events
  * Capture **t**race ids
* [Instrumenting distributed systems for operational visibility](https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/instrumenting-distributed-systems-for-operational-visibility/): Here's an old favourite of mine from amazon's builders library about logging.
