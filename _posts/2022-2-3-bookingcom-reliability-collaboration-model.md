This was a great guest blog post on Honeycomb. Lists regular operations tasks as well as different degrees of support afforded to service teams by a constrained SRE team. When a system gets big enough you can't afford to give every aspect of it premium support! It's also true that not every component is equally important. This forces you to think about that.
