* [ActivityPub Server in a Single PHP File](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/02/activitypub-server-in-a-single-file/): Love this tiny activitypub implementation in php. I'm working on something similar and it's a reminder to me that the kernel of an ap server is straightforward indeed ...
* ['The Cloud Fugitive' | David Heinemeier Hansson | NTK # 001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a30vFpSaoZg): DHH discusses his rationale for leaving aws largely for server hosting. (Sounds like they still use s3.)
* [Cloud Egress Costs](https://getdeploying.com/reference/data-egress?ck_subscriber_id=512840947): Getting your data back out of aws, and gcp, and others is expensive!
* [Moore's Scofflaws](https://oxide.computer/blog/moores-scofflaws): Bryan Cantrill writes about owning your own datacenter hardware, and the software that runs on top of it, and how much it costs to rent this stuff from someone else. 

# Google cloud kms documentation

* [Envelope encryption](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/envelope-encryption): When storing sensitive data create a single use data encryption key (dek), encrypt data, encrypt dek with a server encryption key (sek), then store encrypted data, dek close together. Sek is stored in a key management service. (kms) There are many more deks than seks. Use 1 or a small number of seks per functional area or group.
