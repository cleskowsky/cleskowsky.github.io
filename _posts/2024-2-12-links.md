* [Getting Big Things Done](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2020/10/19/big-changes.html): Our ability to take on bigger projects necessarily involves working together with others, understanding different points of view and meeting people where they are.
* [A guide to running Incident Command](https://argoday.medium.com/incident-command-guide-9872b51d7c94): What an incident commander should do. Reminder that the commander should not be trying to investigate / fix the problem. There is an orchestrating role that is important to a smooth response team.
* [How to conduct a postmortem review meeting](https://argoday.medium.com/how-to-conduct-a-postmortem-review-meeting-8cb5d2d2b303): Nice overview of how to prepare and run the post incident review meeting. Prepare the timeline doc ahead of time, schedule enough time for the meetup, it's nice for a manager to run it to represent the team. Bunch of other good thoughts in here.
