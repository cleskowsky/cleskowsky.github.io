* [The many ways to obtain credentials in AWS](https://www.wiz.io/blog/the-many-ways-to-obtain-credentials-in-aws?ck_subscriber_id=512830353): Lots of different ways to get a credential depending on execution context. Interesting and utterly impossible to remember! :)
* [Break Stuff on Purpose](https://slack.engineering/break-stuff-on-purpose/): Slack lost an elasticsearch cluster and found they didn't have a recent backup and their runbooks were our of date. This sounds familiar. I find at work we write runbooks when we first launch a new service and then all that documentation languishes. Also not having an alert when a backup failed for 2 years ... I feel for them!
