* [Developer Experience at Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2021/01/06/developer-experience-at-netlify/): Developer experience, advocacy. Good overview of how this team is structured at netlify, how it measures success and how they work. (Also what they think is important)
  * The devex teams rotates into product eng roles periodically so they can dogfood the product and build relationships with other devs at netlify
  * They write code and documentation. In different amounts based on the particular team they're on
  * They are trying to keep on top of several big, gnarly js frameworks. Eep! :)
