* [SREcon25 Americas - Using Statistical Techniques to Automatically Detect Game-Breaking Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg7RjuMlcGI): A bit of math and python and transformers (take a line of text with words and extract semantic meaning which seems like vectorizing that input into a list of floating point numbers that can be used to look for similarity?) to find interesting clusters of events in a huge amount of logs (netflix)
* [Jane Goodall: Discussing Chimpanzee Behavior (Full Episode) | Startalk | National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztjcf7iR5DE): Brilliant pre-covid startalk episode with Jane Goodall
* [How One Of NYC's Best Chefs Makes Pancakes | Made to Order | Bon App√©tit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rWNO3bM_BY): Fluffy pancakes from Golden Diner in new york. Added to our list of spots to check out if we ever make it there :)
* [Introducing MavenGate: a supply chain attack method for Java and Android applications](https://blog.oversecured.com/Introducing-MavenGate-a-supply-chain-attack-method-for-Java-and-Android-applications/): Maven dependencies can be vectors for attack when library authors stop working on the project and let the domain lapse.
* [Python 3.14](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/8/python-314/#atom-blogmarks): Looks like a nice update. Performance is better and a few other things have been added / improved.

# The clean architecture

Important ideas:

* Layers
* Directionality of dependencies
* Isolate business entities from externalities like frameworks, databases, connected systems, etc
* How information is passed between layers (simple dictionaries, dtos, etc)

Feels like a tasteful way to organize application logic (ie the code we write) for understanding and maintainability.
