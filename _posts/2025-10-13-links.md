* [SREcon25 Americas - Using Statistical Techniques to Automatically Detect Game-Breaking Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg7RjuMlcGI): A bit of math and python and transformers (take a line of text with words and extract semantic meaning which seems like vectorizing that input into a list of floating point numbers that can be used to look for similarity?) to find interesting clusters of events in a huge amount of logs (netflix)
* [Jane Goodall: Discussing Chimpanzee Behavior (Full Episode) | Startalk | National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztjcf7iR5DE): Brilliant pre-covid startalk episode with Jane Goodall
* [How One Of NYC's Best Chefs Makes Pancakes | Made to Order | Bon App√©tit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rWNO3bM_BY): Fluffy pancakes from Golden Diner in new york. Added to our list of spots to check out if we ever make it there :)
