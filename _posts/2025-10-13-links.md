* [SREcon25 Americas - Using Statistical Techniques to Automatically Detect Game-Breaking Issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sg7RjuMlcGI): A bit of math and python and transformers (take a line of text with words and extract semantic meaning which seems like vectorizing that input into a list of floating point numbers that can be used to look for similarity?) to find interesting clusters of events in a huge amount of logs (netflix)
* [Jane Goodall: Discussing Chimpanzee Behavior (Full Episode) | Startalk | National Geographic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ztjcf7iR5DE): Brilliant pre-covid startalk episode with Jane Goodall
* [How One Of NYC's Best Chefs Makes Pancakes | Made to Order | Bon App√©tit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1rWNO3bM_BY): Fluffy pancakes from Golden Diner in new york. Added to our list of spots to check out if we ever make it there :)
* [Introducing MavenGate: a supply chain attack method for Java and Android applications](https://blog.oversecured.com/Introducing-MavenGate-a-supply-chain-attack-method-for-Java-and-Android-applications/): Maven dependencies can be vectors for attack when library authors stop working on the project and let the domain lapse.
* [Python 3.14](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/8/python-314/#atom-blogmarks): Looks like a nice update. Performance is better and a few other things have been added / improved.
* [Built for SF by SF: AI Solutions Helping Our City Thrive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EDqQtysycT4): OpenAI dev day video with a few local projects in san francisco described. My favourites are the first and third vides - cleansf, and a future projection app for how city planners can improve neighbourhoods for people that live there.

# The clean architecture

Important ideas:

* Layers
* Directionality of dependencies
* Isolate business entities from externalities like frameworks, databases, connected systems, etc
* How information is passed between layers (simple dictionaries, dtos, etc)

Feels like a tasteful way to organize application logic (ie the code we write) for understanding and maintainability.

# OpenAI dev day agentic workflows

* [Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KplSDxYv9xU): Here's the dev day video I watched. Neat idea here about how to structure a computation / workflow using agents.

* Agentic workflows
    * Agent builder
    * Chatkit
* Agentkit
* Getting to the goal is broken down into discrete agents
* Verification of outputs is talked about and is probably super important as we write less code - we should be able to tell what we have is correct and we should be able to refactor (a recent paper about this came our recommended by Mark Brooker)

OpenAI has a nice workflow that creates a pipeline with stages consisting of individual agents that pass output to the next

![Chatkit agentkit builder openai screenshot shows a workflow including input from user through various agents leading to an output back to the user hopefully with the information they requested](/assets/2025/chatkit_builder_openai.png)
