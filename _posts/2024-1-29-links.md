* [Someone attacked our company](https://usefathom.com/blog/ddos-attack): Fathom analytics describes living through a serious ddos attack and the various stages it progresses through. My blood pressure was rising from 1 paragraph to the next. I have no idea what it must have been like to be there. 1 important turning point seeming to be when they called out to Aws Shield for help.
