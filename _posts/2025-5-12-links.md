* 2025-05-19
  * [Paper: when resilience engineering questions ergonomics](https://ferd.ca/notes/paper-when-resilience-engineering-questions-ergonomics.html):
    * Notes
      * Work as imagined vs work as done
      * Safety-I vs Safety-II
        * Safety-I focuses on avoiding failure, attention to adverse events, and root causes (Older analysis model)
        * Safety-II is about studying how systems get to good outcomes in a changing environment (considering both good and bad adversities). Looking at how good outcomes happen which is hopefully how most system events turn out (Newer analysis model)
      * Gap between the two and how to bridge
      * Gradually draw WAI to WAD by observing system interactions with healthy outcomes and building limits, processes, knowledge sharing activities around that
    * Tags: resilience, safety-i, safety-ii, papers, fredhebert
  * [Making Super Slurper 5x faster with Workers, Durable Objects, and Queues](https://blog.cloudflare.com/making-super-slurper-five-times-faster/)
    * Notes
      * A queue +worker pool and a move towards the Cloudflare serverless
    * Tags: architecture, serverless, jobqueues, cloudflare
  * [How GitHub engineers learn new codebases](https://github.blog/developer-skills/application-development/how-github-engineers-learn-new-codebases/):
    * Notes
      * I like this. A standardized way to get started with a new service. Template included. :)
    * Tags: github, mermaidjs, diagrams, learning


* 2025-05-12
  * [AWS KMS: How many keys do I need?](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-kms-how-many-keys-do-i-need/): A few
    things to consider:
      * Data classification: if there is private data like health care, or identity vs public data there is probably a
        case for 2 keys
      * Roles: who is responsible for key management - rotation, deactivation, etc
      * Teams: security team, development, operations may have different reasons to access keys
          * Another split here could be around business units within a company (different applications)
      * Reasons for access and least privilege: consider workflows around keys and map those to roles, teams
      * Manageability: Every key adds operational overhead. Too few is a problem but so is too many
      * Note: Applications need to be able to work with multiple keys for rotation
  * [Gotta Go Slow](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/gotta-go-slow-avoiding-burnout): "I tell everyone I work with to make
    sure their health is not the implicit buffer used to amortize their organization’s shortfalls. You can’t personally
    absorb all the shocks of a flawed system that may or may not actively be forcing you in that position."
  * [On work processes and outcomes](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/05/10/on-work-processes-and-outcomes/): Work
    you're officially supposed to do (this isn't always what happens in real life - people find unique and unexpected ways
    to get to goals) vs work as actually performed. Good and bad outcomes will always follow actions.
  * [Reservoir Sampling](https://samwho.dev/reservoir-sampling/): Algorithm for fair sampling in a stream of data.
  * [Just fucking use HTML](https://justfuckingusehtml.com/): Funny. Html will probably work 30 years from now. Will react
    and vue webapps?
