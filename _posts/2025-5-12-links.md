* [AWS KMS: How many keys do I need?](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-kms-how-many-keys-do-i-need/): A few things to consider:
  * Data classification: if there is private data like health care, or identity vs public data there is probably a case for 2 keys 
  * Roles: who is responsible for key management - rotation, deactivation, etc
  * Teams: security team, development, operations may have different reasons to access keys
    * Another split here could be around business units within a company (different applications)
  * Reasons for access and least privilege: consider workflows around keys and map those to roles, teams
  * Manageability: Every key adds operational overhead. Too few is a problem but so is too many
  * Note: Applications need to be able to work with multiple keys for rotation
