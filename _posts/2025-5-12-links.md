* [AWS KMS: How many keys do I need?](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/aws-kms-how-many-keys-do-i-need/): A few
  things to consider:
    * Data classification: if there is private data like health care, or identity vs public data there is probably a
      case for 2 keys
    * Roles: who is responsible for key management - rotation, deactivation, etc
    * Teams: security team, development, operations may have different reasons to access keys
        * Another split here could be around business units within a company (different applications)
    * Reasons for access and least privilege: consider workflows around keys and map those to roles, teams
    * Manageability: Every key adds operational overhead. Too few is a problem but so is too many
    * Note: Applications need to be able to work with multiple keys for rotation
* [Gotta Go Slow](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/gotta-go-slow-avoiding-burnout): "I tell everyone I work with to
  make
  sure their health is not the implicit buffer used to amortize their organization’s shortfalls. You can’t
  personally
  absorb all the shocks of a flawed system that may or may not actively be forcing you in that position."
* [On work processes and outcomes](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/05/10/on-work-processes-and-outcomes/): Work
  you're officially supposed to do (this isn't always what happens in real life - people find unique and unexpected
  ways
  to get to goals) vs work as actually performed. Good and bad outcomes will always follow actions.
* [Reservoir Sampling](https://samwho.dev/reservoir-sampling/): Algorithm for fair sampling in a stream of data.
* [Just fucking use HTML](https://justfuckingusehtml.com/): Funny. Html will probably work 30 years from now. Will
  react
  and vue webapps?
