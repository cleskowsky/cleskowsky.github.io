title:  "Week 32: fly hosting operations virtualmachine migration lsvd"
---

* [Making Machines Move](https://fly.io/blog/machine-migrations/): Lots of interesting stuff in here. How a small but really cool hosting company was able to move a workload + storage from one physical server to another. (Easily described in a sentence but the details are very tricky to get right!) Also mentioned is something called lsvd - log-structured virtual disk. It's a way to use local nvme ssd storage for better than network attached storage performance with the safety of being data-backed by something with the durability guarantees (and low cost potentially) of s3.
