title:  "Week 32: fly hosting operations virtualmachine migration lsvd, jenkins pipelines when monorepos groovy, jenkins job parameters, ebpf, spring modules business logic layout planning"
---

* [Making Machines Move](https://fly.io/blog/machine-migrations/): Lots of interesting stuff in here. How a small but really cool hosting company was able to move a workload + storage from one physical server to another. (Easily described in a sentence but the details are very tricky to get right!) Also mentioned is something called lsvd - log-structured virtual disk. It's a way to use local nvme ssd storage for better than network attached storage performance with the safety of being data-backed by something with the durability guarantees (and low cost potentially) of s3.
* [How to manage Monorepos within a Jenkinsfile in CloudBees CI](https://docs.cloudbees.com/docs/cloudbees-ci-kb/latest/client-and-managed-controllers/how-to-build-monorepos-in-cloudbees-ci): Use when with a changeset specification. This would work for us at work.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent none
    stages {
        stage('Build Frontend') {
            agent { docker { image 'my-node-agent' } }
            when {
                changeset "**/frontend/*.*"
                beforeAgent true
            }
            steps {
                dir('frontend') {
                  sh 'npm install'
                  sh '...'
                }
            }
        }
        stage('Build Web') {
            agent { docker { image 'my-maven-agent' } }
            when {
                changeset "**/backend/web/*.*"
                beforeAgent true
            }
            steps {
               dir ('backend/web') {
                sh 'mvn -B -DskipTests clean package'
                sh '...'
               }
            }
        }
        stage('Build REST API') {
            agent { docker { image 'my-golang-agent' } }
            when {
                changeset "**/backend/api/*.*"
                beforeAgent true
            }
            steps {
               dir ('backend/api') {
                 sh 'go build'
                 sh '...'
               }
            }
        }
    }
}

* [Jenkins pipeline 'when'](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/#when): The previous link got me wanting to take a closer look at the "when" pipeline keyword... :)
* [Guide to Jenkins Parameterized Builds](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/jenkins-parameterized-builds): Short overview of how to define job parameters and how to trigger a job that sets parameters.
* [No More Blue Fridays](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2024-07-22/no-more-blue-fridays.html): eBPF in linux and soon windows kernels will help prevent the kind of failure we saw in a Crowdstrike kernel driver recently. From the article "Other ways to reduce risk include testing, staged rollouts, and resilience engineering."
* [Designing Module Interactions in Modulithic Spring Applications](https://speakerdeck.com/olivergierke/it-takes-two-to-tango-designing-module-interactions-in-modulithic-spring-applications): How to structure business logic in Spring for 1 particular transaction within an application. Interesting new idea is how to think about failure as you decompose logic into more focused building blocks.
