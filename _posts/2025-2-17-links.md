* [AWS re:Invent 2024 - How Netflix handles sudden load spikes in the cloud (NFX301)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkFyZyxFRBM&list=WL&index=1&t=1230s): Lots of techniques incorporated into a mixed proactive-reactive resilience strategy. A few things that I took away:
  * Services that take a long time to start need to start scaling sooner
  * Detect, provision infra, start applications, recover
  * Awareness of traffic priorities at a per client / request level
  * Traffic is migrated as needed between regions
  * Retries are thoughtfully implemented (1 or 2 quick ones to try to find a server that's less utilized before giving up)
