* [AWS re:Invent 2024 - How Netflix handles sudden load spikes in the cloud (NFX301)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkFyZyxFRBM&list=WL&index=1&t=1230s): Lots of techniques incorporated into a mixed proactive-reactive resilience strategy. A few things that I took away:
  * Services that take a long time to start need to start scaling sooner
  * Detect, provision infra, start applications, recover
  * Awareness of traffic priorities at a per client / request level
  * Traffic is migrated as needed between regions
  * Retries are thoughtfully implemented (1 or 2 quick ones to try to find a server that's less utilized before giving up)
* [Enhancing Netflix Reliability with Service-Level Prioritized Load Shedding](https://netflixtechblog.com/enhancing-netflix-reliability-with-service-level-prioritized-load-shedding-e735e6ce8f7d): Per request priority that's tied into load shedding and autoscaling @ Netflix. Neat stuff. Lots of progress in serving as much user traffic as they can.
* [Do-nothing scripting: the key to gradual automation](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/): I like this idea. The beginning of automation! :)

```python
import sys
 
def wait_for_enter():
    raw_input("Press Enter to continue: ")
 
class CreateSSHKeypairStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Run:")
        print("   ssh-keygen -t rsa -f ~/{0}".format(context["username"]))
        wait_for_enter()
 
class GitCommitStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Copy ~/new_key.pub into the `user_keys` Git repository, then run:")
        print("    git commit {0}".format(context["username"]))
        print("    git push")
        wait_for_enter()
 
class WaitForBuildStep(object):
    build_url = "http://example.com/builds/user_keys"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Wait for the build job at {0} to finish".format(self.build_url))
        wait_for_enter()
 
class RetrieveUserEmailStep(object):
    dir_url = "http://example.com/directory"
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to {0}".format(self.dir_url))
        print("Find the email address for user `{0}`".format(context["username"]))
        context["email"] = raw_input("Paste the email address and press enter: ")
 
class SendPrivateKeyStep(object):
    def run(self, context):
        print("Go to 1Password")
        print("Paste the contents of ~/new_key into a new document")
        print("Share the document with {0}".format(context["email"]))
        wait_for_enter()
 
if __name__ == "__main__":
    context = {"username": sys.argv[1]}
    procedure = [
        CreateSSHKeypairStep(),
        GitCommitStep(),
        WaitForBuildStep(),
        RetrieveUserEmailStep(),
        SendPrivateKeyStep(),
    ]
    for step in procedure:
        step.run(context)
    print("Done.")

* [The Parker Solar Probe Just Made History](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3thMYuhp7ec): A space probe orbiting the sun currently based on ideas from Eugene Parker who spent a lot of time thinking about solar winds and particles ejected from the sun at high levels of energy and how they would interact with planets.
* [Laracon EU :: Jess Archer // Nightwatch Returns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j6z_oq4cZU): It's nice to see what good looks like sometimes. This is an automatic monitoring solution for laravel based apps that will come out this year.
