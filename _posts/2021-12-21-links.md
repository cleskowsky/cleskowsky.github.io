* [When to shard mongodb](https://www.percona.com/blog/2017/10/16/when-should-i-enable-mongodb-sharding/): A short list of reasons you may want to consider sharding. Sharding adds a bunch of complexity to a db cluster so deferring this as long as you can is often a great choice. (Many datasets never get big enough to warrant the extra complexity.) Things like disaster recovery time to restore service, available resources on a single machine, hot data + cold data and a few more. Pretty nice list here!
