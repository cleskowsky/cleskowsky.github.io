title:  "Week 16: prometheus uoft, backups automation"
---

* [Our setup of Prometheus and Grafana (as of the end of 2019)](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/PrometheusGrafanaSetup-2019): Practical initial setup of prometheus and related processes circa 2019 at University of Toronto.
* [You should automate some basic restore testing of your backups](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/AutomateSomeBackupRestoreTests): This seems like a good idea.
