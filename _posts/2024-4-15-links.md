* [Our setup of Prometheus and Grafana (as of the end of 2019)](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/PrometheusGrafanaSetup-2019): Practical initial setup of prometheus and related processes circa 2019 at University of Toronto.
* [You should automate some basic restore testing of your backups](https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/AutomateSomeBackupRestoreTests): This seems like a good idea.
* [Everything I know about the XZ backdoor](https://boehs.org/node/everything-i-know-about-the-xz-backdoor): Story of a backdoor in sshd introduced over a number of years. The hackers were patient if nothing else.
* [The "I Don't Know" Problem: Twelve questions for your engineering leadership](https://www.pluralsight.com/resources/blog/leadership/twelve-questions-for-your-engineering-team): Several more good questions to add to the spolsky test that is apparently 25 years old now but still very relevant!
