* [Prompt caching: 10x cheaper LLM tokens, but how?](https://ngrok.com/blog/prompt-caching/): A lot
  of compute is waste
  when generating output token by token. Llms work by feeding the same prompt into the model over
  and over again but 1 token longer than the last time and each time doing the same amount of work +
  a bit more for the next token.
* [How to think about durable execution](https://hatchet.run/blog/durable-execution): A transaction
  is automated as a series of idempotent steps (sometimes steps must be taken in a specific order)
  with state stored along the way so an orchestrator can ensure every step completes successfully
  and retried if needed. Nice programming model this. (Temporal is similar)
* [Cooking with Claude](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/23/cooking-with-claude/#atom-everything):
  Nice use of llm to
  help cook 2 meal kit dinners at once
* [How uv got so fast](https://nesbitt.io/2025/12/26/how-uv-got-so-fast.html): UV is quite amazing.
  I've tried it for very simple things and even in my minimal usage I could tell something was very
  different about how installing dependencies felt in python. There are good reasons for why it
  feels so good
    * Skips a bunch of work pip does for legacy reasons
    * Uses something called http range requests (you can ask for a part of a file!! which is handy
      is you're downloading zip files - you can request just the index and see if what you need to
      in the file)
    * Python the language changed in ways that allowed a more efficient tool to exist
    * A better dependency resolver / solver
    * and several more important enhancements! :)
* [How Rob Pike got spammed with an AI slop “act of kindness”](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/26/slop-acts-of-kindness/):
  Rob has some truth to speak.
* [A deep dive into BPF LPM trie performance and optimization](https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-deep-dive-into-bpf-lpm-trie-performance-and-optimization/): Tries are pretty neat for efficiently storing a set of strings where there are common prefixes in your data. (eg network routing tables)
