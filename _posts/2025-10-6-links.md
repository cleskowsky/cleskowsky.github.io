title: "Weekly notes: Watched a great lecture on software engineering by Rob pike"
---

* [How Long Contexts Fail](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/22/how-contexts-fail-and-how-to-fix-them.html): Interesting findings about the kinds of problems that come up working with llms. A few of the takeaways for me:
  * 1 long prompt is better than multiple short ones
  * conflicting information in a context might badly impact results
* [COMP1531 Week 4 Lecture 2 | Rob Pike and HTTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SlasmhEcXDo): Good software is:

- Correct
  - Does the right thing
- Well specified
- Reliable
  - Doesn't return incorrect answers
  - Doesn't fail silently
- Maintainable
  - Easy to change
    - Bug fixes
    - New features
  - Easy to learn
- Debugging is part of software engineering - learn to love it!
  - Always start from the fact (eg this one use case failed in this specific way ... why??!)
- Software engineering is not just programming. It is â€¦
  - Engineering
  - Technical
  - Social

Guest lecture by Rob Pike
* [How I write production-ready Spring Boot applications](https://www.wimdeblauwe.com/blog/2025/06/24/how-i-write-production-ready-spring-boot-applications/): Interesting ideas for me in here that I want to try:
  * Find the aggregate roots (from domain driven design)
  * Try single action use cases over massive service classes
