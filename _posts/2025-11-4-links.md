* [The fetch()ening](https://htmx.org/essays/the-fetchening/): Htmx is getting a
  new major release version. Sounds like a solid upgrade. I love the philosophy
  behind this project. Small, purpose built, server side rendering, very stable,
  grounded in the original ideas behind hypermedia.
* [Deploying to Amazon's cloud is a pain in the AWS younger devs won't tolerate](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/aws_genz_misery_nope/).
  Yep.
* [The Rule Of 2](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md):
  Consider 3 categories of risk when deciding whether new behaviour should
  land - trustworthiness of inputs, the implementation language, and the
  privilege mode it has to run in. You can't have more than 2 of those. Tricks
  to de-fang some of the issues here are to run code in a sandbox, or building
  safety guardrails around something that is otherwise unsafe.
* [Importing vs fetching JSON](https://jakearchibald.com/2025/importing-vs-fetching-json/): Interesting. I guess there's a need to read data locally if you are bundling code and data into a package that is a deployable unit?
* [Should You Use Big Models or Services?](https://laracasts.com/series/jeremys-larabits/episodes/29): "Models are nouns, and services are verbs.", "When your method needs to interact with multiple models maybe extracting it is a good choice.", "It's all subjective in the end."
* [Game design is simple, actually](https://www.raphkoster.com/2025/11/03/game-design-is-simple-actually/): Lots of ideas in here about what makes us tick. I can recognize stuff he talks about in some of the games I have really enjoyed playing like practice, and obstacles progressively getting harder. The framing is interesting of play as problem mastery and predictability!
* [You Should Write An Agent](https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/): Agents are simpler to write then I thought. Using one of the big llm providers, all we have to do allegedly is provide context (an array of strings) and a prompt.

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
context = []

def call():
    return client.responses.create(model="gpt-5", input=context)

def process(line):
    context.append({"role": "user", "content": line})
    response = call()    
    context.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response.output_text})        
    return response.output_text
```

* [Supply chain attacks, npm](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/security-best-practices#supply-chain-attacks): Pinning, lockfiles, npm ci, and scanning.
* [How I Use Every Claude Code Feature](https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature): Practical tips for claude and other llms.
* [What we look for in a resume](https://huyenchip.com/2023/01/24/what-we-look-for-in-a-candidate.html): Great.
  * Demonstrated expertise, not keywords
    * Show how you acquired and use that skill in your job
    * Share your expertise on public channels such as: StackOverflow answers, open source contributions, papers, blog posts
  * We look for people who get things done
    * Initiative - Can you start something that matters?
    * Persistence - Can you see those hard things through? Getting other people on board, making them feel safe and like participants, following up, etc
  * We look for unique perspectives (Do they have any interesting projects and are unique? Or interesting life experience? Or writing? that demonstrates a different point of view?)
  * We care about impact, not meaningless metrics - Relate to business objectives and team impact
  * 1 pagers are great but if you have more to say 2 is fine
