* [The fetch()ening](https://htmx.org/essays/the-fetchening/): Htmx is getting a
  new major release version. Sounds like a solid upgrade. I love the philosophy
  behind this project. Small, purpose built, server side rendering, very stable,
  grounded in the original ideas behind hypermedia.
* [Deploying to Amazon's cloud is a pain in the AWS younger devs won't tolerate](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/04/aws_genz_misery_nope/).
  Yep.
* [The Rule Of 2](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/main/docs/security/rule-of-2.md):
  Consider 3 categories of risk when deciding whether new behaviour should
  land - trustworthiness of inputs, the implementation language, and the
  privilege mode it has to run in. You can't have more than 2 of those. Tricks
  to de-fang some of the issues here are to run code in a sandbox, or building
  safety guardrails around something that is otherwise unsafe.
