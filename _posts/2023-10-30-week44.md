title:  "Week 44: gitlab terraform incident, bittorrent, outage cloudflare deployer"
---

* [Incident Review for Site-wide Outage for GitLab.com - Stale Terraform Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/15999): Never run an old plan against an environment 
* [BitTorrent v2](https://blog.libtorrent.org/2020/09/bittorrent-v2/): Technical description of bittorrent v2. Good bits around the improvements that were made to v1. These kinds of changes probably have to be made over time as you learn about a system. You probably don't know up front where the opportunities for making things better are going to be. (Or the pain points.) You can try to guess but if you're doing something you haven't done before that'll be tricky. Heck even you do have direct experience. :)
* [Cloudflare incident on October 30, 2023](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-incident-on-october-30-2023/): Walkthrough of a very recent cf workers outage. Language is good - transparency, apology, learning, improvement. My instinctive takeaways I guess are automation is hard and complexity doesn't make it any easier. (There's much to be said about keeping systems as small and simple as possible. But no simpler.)
