title:  "Week 44: gitlab terraform incident, bittorrent"
---

* [Incident Review for Site-wide Outage for GitLab.com - Stale Terraform Pipeline](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-infra/production/-/issues/15999): Never run an old plan against an environment 
* [BitTorrent v2](https://blog.libtorrent.org/2020/09/bittorrent-v2/): Technical description of bittorrent v2. Good bits around the improvements that were made to v1. These kinds of changes probably have to be made over time as you learn about a system. You probably don't know up front where the opportunities for making things better are going to be. (Or the pain points.) You can try to guess but if you're doing something you haven't done before that'll be tricky. Heck even you do have direct experience. :)
