* [You donâ€™t get to be a creative and not fall on a regular basis. Every time you show someone your work.](https://twitter.com/delivreal/status/1434367281648308226): This applies to people who aren't designers too I think. Showing something you make to others who may criticize you or worse is kinda scary. Making people feel safe doing stuff like this is great.
