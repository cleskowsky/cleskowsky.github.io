* [How to Scale Your Impact at the Staff-Plus Level](https://www.infoq.com/articles/scale-impact-staff-plus/?trk=public_post_comment-text): Things to avoid and get better at in here. Delegation, cross team communication, and making something nebulous and ambiguous more concrete. Emphasis on helping to identify points of leverage for the team and organization becomes important here too.

Nice little thread about value vs promise vs cost of llms. It's not clear yet that we're going to be able to get out of the current llm craze what certain people have put in.

* [AWS in 2025: The Stuff You Think You Know Thatâ€™s Now Wrong](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/blog/aws-in-2025-the-stuff-you-think-you-know-thats-now-wrong/): Stuff that has changed about aws over the years. Nice list.
* [Under the hood: how AWS Lambda SnapStart optimizes function startup latency](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/under-the-hood-how-aws-lambda-snapstart-optimizes-function-startup-latency/): A snapshot is taken of a lambda function in a way that makes it useful as a starting point for future invocations that make the bootstrap process more efficient.
* [Easy will always trump simple](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/08/17/easy-will-always-trump-simple/): Easy wins because simple is hard to reason about and implement sometimes.
* [Can LLMs replace on call SREs today?](https://clickhouse.com/blog/llm-observability-challenge): Clickhouse runs a test using well known failure scenarios in a demo application to determine how well various llms will be able to figure out what's going on. At this point llms are a replacement for people.
* [Cloudflare incident on August 21, 2025](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-incident-on-august-21-2025/): We saw this in our pre-prod environments the other day. Traffic management controls and fairness in multitenant systems usually come in after you have a successful product as far as I have seen in my work life. Often takes a moment like this to get visibility on the need for a project like this. (Non-functional requirements ftw!)
* [Dynamo, DynamoDB, and Aurora DSQL](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/08/15/dynamo-dynamodb-dsql.html): Some great tech built by amazon over the years between dynamo (voldemort?), dynamodb, and dsql.
* [Designing Software in the Large](https://dafoster.net/articles/2025/07/22/designing-software-in-the-large/): Notes from the book A philosophy of software design. I also enjoyed this book a lot. Concise with many good ideas to think about.
