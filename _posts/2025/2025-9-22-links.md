* [OxCon 2025: Update on Update](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-ZLz8Wg34s): Great talk on how to deliver something that was hard and took a long time. (focus, prioritization, important non-blocking (ie defer))
  * If we didn't do this thing right now, what would happen?
    * Is it likely to happen?
    * How bad is it if it did?
    * Can we make it a little bit better without a complete fix?
    * Do we ship anyway with the limitation?
* [Systems Software in the Large](https://oxide.computer/blog/systems-software-in-the-large): Companion post to above
* [No more disks: the architecture behind stateless compute in ClickHouse Cloud](https://clickhouse.com/blog/clickhouse-cloud-stateless-compute): Phases for moving away from ephemeral storage on db nodes to object storage (s3) for data + compute for retrieval
