* [Some thoughts on LLMs and Software Development](https://martinfowler.com/articles/202508-ai-thoughts.html): Random thoughts. AI bubble : yes. Code completion : no. Replace programmers : who knows?!
* [Big O](https://samwho.dev/big-o/): Basic refresher about big o algorithm classification. Well done. I like Sam's interative teaching blogs a lot.
* [The Star Schema: Making Your Data Warehouse Shine](https://motherduck.com/learn-more/star-schema-data-warehouse-guide/): The data model for your reporting db should probably look different vs the transactional db. (oltp) For sufficiently large data anyways.
* [Lessons from U.S. Army Special Ops on Becoming a Leader](https://hbr.org/2025/08/lessons-from-u-s-army-special-ops-on-becoming-a-leader): Like this article a lot. 4 kinds of leadership failure:
  * Initiative (When you freeze up because you haven't seen something before or you can't get to a constructive mindset quick enough)
    * Trick : Do anything just to get started moving
    * Trick : Ask someone you trust for advice
  * Confidence (Hesitation and self-doubt)
  * Ideas (0 or 1 plan and inability to see more which begets anger)
    * Trick : Practice planning
  * Strategy (Can't see the goal or the goal isn't specific, achievable or good enough)
    * Trick : Think about what goals actually matter in the next few years
  * Dimensions to assess leadership
    * Integrity
    * Mental agility
    * Sound judgment
    * Innovation
    * Leads by example
    * Develops others
    * Gets results (defined as “developing and executing plans while providing direction, guidance, and clear priorities towards mission accomplishment”)
* [Disney World Is the Happiest Place on Earth, if You Can Afford It - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/08/28/opinion/disney-world-economy-middle-class-rich.html?unlocked_article_code=1.iU8.iPLq.TAZ0sm3MhAUY&smid=url-share): I've visited disneyworld several times over the last 10 years and I have watched things get more expensive over time. It's been pretty sad.
