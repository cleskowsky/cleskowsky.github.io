* [Resilience: some key ingredients](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/02/15/resilience-some-key-ingredients/): What happens when a workload greater than a system was designed to handle is applied? Components of a system that can be resilient:
	* resources, 
	* flexibility, 
	* expertise, 
	* diversity or thinking / viewpoints, 
	* coordination
* [Why you should probably be using SQLite](https://www.epicweb.dev/why-you-should-probably-be-using-sqlite): Making for using sqlite in more places. Recently I have learned it's already everywhere on my phone ... why not as storage backends for remote services. I wonder where the limits are for throughput and concurrency.
* [Vaultwarden Serverless](https://chasedouglas.net/p/vaultwarden-serverless): Architecture and design discussion of implementing a password manager using lambda and dsql as the storage backend.
