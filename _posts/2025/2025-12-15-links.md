* [Egoless Engineering](https://egoless.engineering/): Great ideas here:
  * A task (frontend, backend, ops, security, etc) does not equate to a role
  * Senior people don't own, they teach
  * Isolating a team from certain kinds of work isn't sustainable nor does it always produce the best outcomes (eg dev from ops, security)
  * Let them deploy and build safety nets and gaurdrails (tests, promotion process, feature flags, etc)
* [How Programming Changed](https://blog.puzzmo.com/posts/2025/12/9/tech-2025/#how-programming-changed): "70% of my lines of code is now written by Claude Code" :/
* [AI, DevOps, and Kubernetes: Kelsey Hightower on What’s Next](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdUbTyvrfKo): Chat with Kelsey Hightower. Talks about:
  * Workload apis are a sign our aesthetic for describing programs we want to run to a computer are changing and that they're a super important touchpoint in our systems for making code run (eg vms with scripts, docker, k8s / helm, application servers like tomcat)
  * How to describe your intention to a computer (natural language or other)
  * Platform engineering is thinking about contracts between applications and execution environment and making them easy to grok
  * Want to hide details about specialized problem domains from other layers in a system (eg a developer shouldn't have to worry about how infrastructure works)
  * Bold claim: LLMs freeze human knowledge now in 2025 and are we saying all future code can be written by them
  * We have many different languages in our systems (terrafrom, ansible, sql / other db query language, java, css, html, javascript, json, xml, etc) and we're required to understand them all - an llm allows us to go from intention to running code in various dialects quicker
  * When evaluating a new tool
    * What is it?
    * How does it work?
    * Why does it exist? (Why couldn't we just use the previous thing?)
