* [The many ways to obtain credentials in AWS](https://www.wiz.io/blog/the-many-ways-to-obtain-credentials-in-aws?ck_subscriber_id=512830353): Lots of different ways to get a credential depending on execution context. Interesting and utterly impossible to remember! :)
* [Break Stuff on Purpose](https://slack.engineering/break-stuff-on-purpose/): Slack lost an elasticsearch cluster and found they didn't have a recent backup and their runbooks were our of date. This sounds familiar. I find at work we write runbooks when we first launch a new service and then all that documentation languishes. Also not having an alert when a backup failed for 2 years ... I feel for them!
* [GitHub Availability Report: December 2024](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-availability-report-december-2024/): Here's another failure report this time from github. Planned maintenance increased load on a system in a way that prevented monitoring from seeing what was happening. (For our monitoring systems to work they need enough reserved capacity in a system to be able to collect telemetry.)
* [How to end-to-end test microservices across bounded contexts?](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1426450/Age_of_Darkness_Final_Stand/): Focus on the module under test and mock away everything else.
