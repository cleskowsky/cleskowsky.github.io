* [Top Chef Stats](https://topchefstats.com): I like the design that went into this website. Good
  example of html structure and styling.
* [Optimizing a power display with Claude Code](https://wiredream.com/claude-optimizing/): Claude
  llm helps find slow frontend code in a solar power system reporting ui. It doesn't do as well
  finding a backend issue in this case ...
* [Code research projects with async coding agents like Claude Code and Codex](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Nov/6/async-code-research/):
  Research projects using an empty git repository you hand over to an asynchronous agent and then
  let it work on its own can bear fruit ...
* [Linux Load Averages: Solving the Mystery](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2017-08-08/linux-load-averages.html):
  I keep coming back to this one to remind myself about what load averages represent on linux

# To observability lasanga from dashboard soup

* How the **should** platform
    * Here we get together and talk about invariants in terms of system behaviour
* Prove it does that by applying load
    * Ask questions about how the system is working
* Measure that it is doing what you think it should
    * Dashboards are important but many are 1*off ones built after an incident
    * They should be thought of as something that provides a feeling to help debug an issue in
      production

_Overview dashboard has high level metrics of infra, services, alerts, alert routing, etc. They're a
bunch of jumping off points to more detailed dashboards._

![Structured Events](/assets/2025/structured_log_incident_io.png)

_An example of a structured event._

## Tips

* Key metric observed user response time for a request
* Connect metrics and logs through structured events
* Always log event during panics / crashes
* Visualize service limits
* Do game days that use the observability tooling to look into an issue (they do quarterly)
