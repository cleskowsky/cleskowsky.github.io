* [Amazon EBS now provides visibility into EBS volume initialization status](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/07/amazon-ebs-visibility-volume-initialization-status/): Visibility into the snapshot restore-to-volume warming process for large ebs volumes. This seems kinda nice. Getting to a usable volume after requesting a restore can take a long time.
* [Proven Practices for Succeeding with a Multicloud Strategy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/proven-practices-for-succeeding-with-a-multicloud-strategy/?): Solid multi-cloud strategy advice.
* [De-cloud and de-k8s â€” bringing our apps back home](https://dev.37signals.com/bringing-our-apps-back-home/): 6 weeks to move their first app onto a private cloud they setup after deciding to leave aws. That's really good.
* [3 Years of Extremely Remote Work](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2025-05-22/3-years-of-extremely-remote-work.html): Brendan Gregg's recount of working remotely for the last 3 years. Doesn't sound like a positive experience ... :'(
* [I have not paid a ton of attention to the uproar over RTO policies, bc we are all in on distributed teams and not going back ...](https://bsky.app/profile/charity.wtf/post/3lq4cgak3vk24): Being good at taking care of an in-office team doesn't mean you know how to do remote ones. Some stuff gets harder like aligning teams, transmitting culture, cross-pollinating ideas.
