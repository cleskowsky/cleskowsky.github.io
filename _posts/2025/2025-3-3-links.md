* [Quicksort with Jenkins for Fun and No Profit](https://susam.net/jenkins-quicksort.html): There's a neat factorial example in here using the build() plugin. Looks gnarly but fun. Also describes how to get a local jenkins env going to get to the point where you can write a job like this.
* [SQLite-on-the-Server Is Misunderstood: Better At Hyper-Scale Than Micro-Scale](https://rivet.gg/blog/2025-02-16-sqlite-on-the-server-is-misunderstood): Making the case for a smaller, simpler sqlite on the backend even for high write workloads. The idea is it's easier to partition your data set into smaller chunks since everything's just a file? Replication adds to safety as well.
* [Hallucinations in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/): Code from an llm assistant should always be run in a methodical way to find bugs as you would any other code.
