* [You Should Run a Certificate Transparency Log](https://words.filippo.io/run-sunlight/): A small but mighty aspect of the web trust system. Interesting to see what it takes in terms of physical machines to power this service - less than you'd think for a service related to all tls certificates on the internet.
* [Under engineering is just fine](https://www.matthinchliffe.dev/2021/01/27/under-engineering-is-just-fine): So much this. Flow rate of work through the system can certainly be better smoothed out, and time to sync both instances of the application can be reduced, but it's unnecessary in this particular system, and it would add extra complexity. They didn't do it.
* [THOUGHTS ON MOTIVATION AND MY 40-YEAR CAREER](https://charity.wtf/2025/07/09/thoughts-on-motivation-and-my-40-year-career/): Charity shares some of how she came to be the person she is today and with all the things she cares about, and the unique point of view she has. :)
* [Leading your engineers towards an AI-assisted future](https://blog.thepete.net/blog/2025/06/26/leading-your-engineers-towards-an-ai-assisted-future/): Creating change across an organization is hard and takes time. I like how it's laid out here. He talks about creating a community of practice for ai. (llm)
  * Phase 1: experiment
  * Phase 2: adopt
  * Phase 3: impact
* [Making file encryption fast and secure for teams with advanced key management](https://dropbox.tech/security/file-encryption-teams-advanced-key-management): Encryption strategy for a big system that takes into account file sharing between users (data block duplication), and performance (team-shared, and namespace / organization level encryption keys). They store files in 4mb chunks, and each chunk gets its own data encryption key.
