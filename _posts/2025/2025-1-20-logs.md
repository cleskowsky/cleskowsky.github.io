# Logging @ Stripe

* [Fast and flexible observability with canonical log lines](https://stripe.com/blog/canonical-log-lines): One of the earliest treatments of canonical log lines I can find. Wide log events are generated in addition to the chattier kind. The wide events have a marker token that's used to filter them in their log analytics tool during production debugging.

## A canonical log line looks like

> timestamp canonical-log-line controller=c action=a time_ms=100 ...

* Additionally they use s3 + redshift for long term storage and search

* [All you need is Wide Events, not “Metrics, Logs and Traces”](https://isburmistrov.substack.com/p/all-you-need-is-wide-events-not-metrics): Another ex-user of scuba from Facebook. 1 log line per request per service, with many key=value dimensions that are searchable, can be aggregated, etc
* [A Practitioner's Guide to Wide Events](https://jeremymorrell.dev/blog/a-practitioners-guide-to-wide-events/): Detailed article about how to do structured logging in a way that will make it easier to find insights later. Lots of standard properties are suggested that have been helpful in the author's experience. Looks like a really great resource for these ideas!
