* Makefile is nice and clean. I didn't realize tf format was so easy to add. I might just do that at work :)
* Making a terraform module looks straightforward enough. The code was easy to read and matches my thoughts around how tf works
* Go is readable but I do need to play with it a bit more if I want to hold on to being able to "think in go". I do work at a java shop primarily so most of my cycles go there. Go has always felt nicer than python for server side tools to me
