# Performance Analysis and Troubleshooting Methodologies for Databases

- Short talk that reminded me about how to be methodical about investigation performance issues
  - USE: Resource centric, Brendan Gregg, utilization + saturation + errors of underlying servers
  - RED: App centric, Tom Wilke, Rate + errors + duration
  - Golden Signals: App centric as well (Overlap with RED), from the SRE book, traffic volume + errors + latency + saturation
- Random googling is not always your friend :)
- Percona has a tool that automates USE metric collection

# G1: To Infinity and Beyond

- Speaker: Stefan Johansson

- Collectors can optimize for 1 or a few of
  - Throughput
  - Latency
  - Memory footprint
- G1 tries to achieve a balance between them (zgc goes for low latency ... sub 1ms pause times achieved!)
- G1 is the default collector in jdk 9+
- Goal: avoid full collections
  - Try to do bulk of work outside full gc span during concurrent steps
- G1 has improved a lot since jdk8 (1000+ patches to this collector)
  - Big improvements in jdk11 + jdk17
