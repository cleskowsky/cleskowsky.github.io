# Performance Analysis and Troubleshooting Methodologies for Databases

- Short talk that reminded me about how to be methodical about investigation performance issues
  - USE: Resource centric, Brendan Gregg, utilization + saturation + errors of underlying servers
  - RED: App centric, Tom Wilke, Rate + errors + duration
  - Golden Signals: App centric as well (Overlap with RED), from the SRE book, traffic volume + errors + latency + saturation
- Random googling is not always your friend :)
- Percona has a tool that automates USE metric collection
