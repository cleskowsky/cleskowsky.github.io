# Performance Analysis and Troubleshooting Methodologies for Databases

- Short talk that reminded me about how to be methodical about investigation performance issues
  - USE: Resource centric, Brendan Gregg, utilization + saturation + errors of underlying servers
  - RED: App centric, Tom Wilke, Rate + errors + duration
  - Golden Signals: App centric as well (Overlap with RED), from the SRE book, traffic volume + errors + latency + saturation
- Random googling is not always your friend :)
- Percona has a tool that automates USE metric collection

# G1: To Infinity and Beyond

- Speaker: Stefan Johansson
- [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckEEncbHGpY)

- Collectors can optimize for 1 or a few of
  - Throughput
  - Latency
  - Memory footprint
- G1 tries to achieve a balance between them (zgc goes for low latency ... sub 1ms pause times achieved!)
- G1 is the default collector in jdk 9+
- Goal: avoid full collections
  - Try to do bulk of work outside full gc span during concurrent steps
- G1 has improved a lot since jdk8 (1000+ patches to this collector)
  - Big improvements in jdk11 + jdk17

# [How to Measure Latency](https://www.p99conf.io/session/how-to-measure-latency/)

- Different between response time vs service time
- Measuring only on the server is insufficient (service time)
  - But this is where we often start because it's easy
  - Only measuring here does not correlate with user experience
  - It hides queuing and other issues in components between the client and backend
- Measuring at the client gives us more information but isn't the full story either
  - You have to do both to be able to reason about some of the things happening in between
  - Queuing! Queues are everywhere and represent things / people waiting for access to a resource
