* [Handling billions of invocations â€“ best practices from AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/handling-billions-of-invocations-best-practices-from-aws-lambda/): Request processing for aws lambda has evolved over time to be able to scale with a growing number of requests per second. Techniques for management async usage are included and become more and more sophisticated:
  * single shared queue for all tenants
  * multi-queue for tenants random placement
  * multi-queue consistent hashing
  * multi-queue random power of 2
  * multi-queue shuffle sharding (choose n queues for a tenant, pick smallest backlog queue for new messages)
