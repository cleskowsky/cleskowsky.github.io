## Security

[Source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/security.html)

A good set of high order principles to keep in mind when I'm building software to run anywhere:

* Identity, least privilege
* Traceability, auditability
* Defence in depth, controls at every layer
* Protect data in transit and at rest
* Think about and practice incident response
* Automate it!

*Notes*

* Understand the shared responsibility model and how I can leverage it to improve security and shift some of the burden of patching and other maintenance tasks to a partner like AWS

## Reliability
## Cost
## Operational Simplicity
## Performance
