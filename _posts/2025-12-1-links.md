* [Brief thoughts on the recent Cloudflare outage](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/11/26/brief-thoughts-on-the-recent-cloudflare-outage/): The Cloudflare incident was interesting because there was a failure mode that had never been seen before and also a co-incident (the status page went down at the same time) that made the context harder to investigate. Another interesting note - protective systems design to help us can sometimes cause harm!
* [Why Strong Consistency?](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/11/18/consistency): Eventual consistency makes it hard to reason about what a reasonable looking program might do given a common read-modify-write type update action.
* [Why I Ignore The Spotlight as a Staff Engineer](https://lalitm.com/software-engineering-outside-the-spotlight/): I don't think I'm a spotlight seeking person either. I'm happiest when I'm helping someone else do great things. And figuring out how to automate something. :)
