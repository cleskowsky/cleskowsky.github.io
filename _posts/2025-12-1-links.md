* [Brief thoughts on the recent Cloudflare outage](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2025/11/26/brief-thoughts-on-the-recent-cloudflare-outage/): The Cloudflare incident was interesting because there was a failure mode that had never been seen before and also a co-incident (the status page went down at the same time) that made the context harder to investigate.
