* [Being hired at automattic](https://deansas.org/2022/01/02/being-hired-at-automattic/): A backend engineer talks about what it's like going through the wordpress.com hiring process. Interesting ideas about using slack for communication and no video until the last couple of steps in the process. There was a small code test and then a bigger one. (30-40 hours!) The blog didn't mention whether it was a paid trial but it is. (Confirmed in automattic's hiring process doc on linked on the main company website.) The process seemed kind of refreshing actually.
