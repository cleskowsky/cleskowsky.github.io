* [AWS re:Invent 2021 - DynamoDB deep dive: Advanced design patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfxBhvGpoa0): Talk by Rick Houlihan about the evolution of databases from the general ledger (written by hand hundreds of years ago) to the relation and nosql systems we have today
  * Note nosql is not non-relational. All data is relational
  * oltp systems can be a good fit for nosql
  * tradeoff in cpu time vs storage. When cpu was cheaper than disk we'd de-dupe data with 3rd normal form (Codd) by stuffing it in homogeneous buckets (1 table per entity eg order_items) and joining to recover a complete entity which would burn a ton of cpu
    * cpu was cheaper than disk and getting cheaper quicker (moore's law)
    * These days storage is getting cheaper every year. Processors have stopped scaling in the same way (as of ~2014)
  * SQL stores are good for olap type applications where you don't understand the access patterns
  * When designing a nosql system you want your data model to line up well with how your app will be using it (use cases, access patterns, etc)
  * Reads start with indexes
    * Create as many indexes as you need
    * Indexes represent a novel partitional / grouping of your underlying data
    * Indexes will duplicate data
    * This is fine
  * Operational characteristics are pretty cool
    * Scale by partitioning data across storage nodes
    * Sharding baked in by use of partition key (primary + secondary key for an index?)
    * burst read / write credits for a table (any provisioned capacity not used in the previous 5m becomes available now for surge handling)
