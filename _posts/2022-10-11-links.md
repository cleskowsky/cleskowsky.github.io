title:  "Links Neil Gaiman interview, Dev tool time with Suz Hilton"
---

* [On-call with Jérôme Petazzoni](https://fiberplane.dev/blog/on-call-with-jerome-petazzoni/): Most recent memory I guess of how Jerome would do on-call: 
  * He'd be the primary on-call 2 days every week or so
  * Pair rotation. There'd be a junior and senior team member on-call at once
  * Junior would try to tackle problems during the day, Senior would handle everything else
  * Pages would be acknowledged within 15-30m
  * If a fix would take upwards of an hour, he'd get other team members involved otherwise he's try to handle an incident on his own (This sounds high. I probably missed something here.)
  * Table top exercises: reboot a server, fill up a vm disk, change a public ip (Nasty lol)
* [Dev tools time: Suz Hinton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNPWV1igjt8): Loved this one. Tools Suz uses a lot. I should check them out:
  * [Bat ("Cat with wings")](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)
  * [Diff so fancy](https://github.com/so-fancy/diff-so-fancy)
  * [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)
* [Excellent interview with Neil Gaiman from August 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWFDQRnSNOk): Talked about Sandman the Netflix series and Good Omens 2 (The first series on Amazon Prime Video was so good :))
