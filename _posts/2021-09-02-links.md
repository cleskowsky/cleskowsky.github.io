* [Brendan Gregg investigates slow large file uploads](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-08-30/high-rate-of-paging.html): On a 64g ram machine he finds that the operating system's page cache is busted for big files the microservice is sometimes trying to upload to s3 (>100gb)
* [Another one from Brendan tracking down a slack app crash bug in linux](https://www.brendangregg.com/blog/2021-08-27/slack-crashes-secret-stderr.html): Neat to see the exercise of him going through different hypotheses and then figuring out how to validate them. A few failures and then success! This is how it always is.
