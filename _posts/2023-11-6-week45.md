title:  "Week 45: mongodb crash recovery, javascript vanilla"
---

* [Journaling and the WiredTiger Storage Engine](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/core/journaling/): We use mongodb at work. It's been fine to work with largely I think. The journaling capability here is fairly neat. It's nice to know there's a write ahead log in here to help recover most writes after an unplanned, hard reset.
* [Cloudflare control plane outage](https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-mortem-on-cloudflare-control-plane-and-analytics-outage/): Writeup from cf about what happened and action items. They move pretty quickly on platform enhancements and don't necessarily require the same level of rigor for everything they push to production. (At least initially.)
* [Writeup by Fred Hebert about the cf incident above](https://www.thevoid.community/incident-detail?recordId=rec7OIQslY0aYVqjA): He says it doesn't come across as cf seeming open to learning about the context in which the failure happened and how the environment made the failure mode possible. Sounds like somebody looking for a political answer / posture.
* [Mastering DOM manipulation with vanilla JavaScript](https://phuoc.ng/collection/html-dom/): Short, instructive javascript tutorials using plain vanilla js. Love this stuff! :)
