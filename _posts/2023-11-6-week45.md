title:  "Week 45: mongodb crash recovery"

* [Journaling and the WiredTiger Storage Engine](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v4.4/core/journaling/): We use mongodb at work. It's been fine to work with largely I think. The journaling capability here is fairly neat. It's nice to know there's a write ahead log in here to help recover most writes after an unplanned, hard reset.
