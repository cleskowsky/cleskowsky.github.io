* [Toasts notifications in Thymeleaf with Shoelace and htmx](https://www.wimdeblauwe.com/blog/2023/02/20/toasts-notifications-in-thymeleaf-with-shoelace-and-htmx/): Shoeleaf looks like a tasteful library of widgets that are accessible be default and nice to look at. I do like server-side-rendering as a model more than lots of logic in the frontend more and more these days.
