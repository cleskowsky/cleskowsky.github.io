* [AWS re:Invent 2017: Snapchat Stories on Amazon DynamoDB (DAT325)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUleQzu9l_8)
  * GCP appengine customer wanted to shift particular functional area over to dynamo
  * First experiment failed to reduce cost like they expected nor did it perform well
  * Failed experiment did give them insight into application changes they could make to reduce number of reads / writes and throughput
  * Saved millions of dollars after network, cpu cost savings
  * Tested in prod. They did dual writes for awhile. (Writes went to the old system and new)
