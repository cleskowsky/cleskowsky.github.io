* Bring back ops pride ([source](https://charity.wtf/2026/01/19/bring-back-ops-pride-xpost/)) talks about operations and development teams as adversaries rather than collaborators trying to build applications that are useful and reliable. I don't love this framing but it is how some teams are setup to be. How can you tell which one you have?
* On using simpler models for tasks via cli tooling vs api calls and mcp servers the latter of which sometimes require the thinking models, [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Jan/17/jeremy-daer/#atom-everything)
* It can be eye opening to hop into a system and look around sometimes to see what's happening ... or runnning :) - [Rachel by the bay](https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2026/01/20/walk/)
* Coordinating large groups of people in a company is hard. Some energy necessarily goes towards keeping everyone moving in the same direction. [Lorin](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2026/01/24/because-coordination-is-expensive/)
* [Why Kubernetes is retiring Ingress NGINX](https://thenewstack.io/kubernetes-to-retire-ingress-nginx/): Sounds like ingress nginx used heavily by k8s users isn't being maintaned well enough to keep the platform secure and will be removed even when there isn't a viable replacement for what it's been doing in a couple months. This must not have been a fun choice for anyone involved to make.
