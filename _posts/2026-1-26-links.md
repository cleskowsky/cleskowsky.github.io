* Bring back ops pride ([source](https://charity.wtf/2026/01/19/bring-back-ops-pride-xpost/)) talks about operations and development teams as adversaries rather than collaborators trying to build applications that are useful and reliable. I don't love this framing but it is how some teams are setup to be. How can you tell which one you have?

AGENTS.md is something that should probably be in any context you want an agent to work in.
