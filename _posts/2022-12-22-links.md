* [The Law of Stretched [Cognitive] Systems](https://ferd.ca/the-law-of-stretched-cognitive-systems.html): I have seen this idea before in other areas. Nature abhors a vacuum. Any slack or excess capacity in a system is eventually put to use / redirected such that you are always operating at the boundaries of safety. It's to be expected.
