* [Reflecting on 18 years at Google](https://ln.hixie.ch/?start=1700627373&count=1): Makes me think of enshitification ...
* [Oxide and Friends 1/15/2024 -- Open Source LLMs with Simon Willison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wqkvn4YyGpA): Wonderful talk between Bryan Cantrill, Adam and Simon Willison about the recent history of LLMs. Sound fairly useful if you know what they're good for. Hint: It's not everything!
* [Creator of HTMX Talks HTMX](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LriHRa9t1fQ): Htmx chat with the creator and ThePrimeagen. Very cool. :)
