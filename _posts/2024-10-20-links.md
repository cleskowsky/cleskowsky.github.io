  * An incident channel is notified with a details message (at this point a priority has been assigned to an incident determining next steps in their incident response workflow - eg p1, p2 triggers slack collaboration across teams)
  * Ticket is created
  * Slack warroom is created (Not for p4, p5 incidents)
  * Incident commander is selected
  * Communication is greatly improved, and they reduced time to declare an incident
