* [Code I like (I): Domain-driven boldness](https://world.hey.com/jorge/code-i-like-i-domain-driven-boldness-71456476): Guided tour of few domain modeling choices within HEY. Thoughtful choices of domain concepts with language rooted in the domain. I liked the written description of the domain and various objects / processing that takes place in the module.
