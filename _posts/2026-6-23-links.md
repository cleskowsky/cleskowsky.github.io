* [SREcon25 Americas - Lies Programmers Believe about Memory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sjyqiMjmZk): Resident memory in top can be misleading.

Cgroups v2 have exposed more detailed information about process memory usage and that data can be surprising! Facebook has a tool that caps memory usage (including different kinds of memory) and dynamically adjusts to help a workload run efficiently.
