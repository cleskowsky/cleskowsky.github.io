title:  "Week 9: incident response status communication automation"

* [Dyninno’s Incident Management: an Introduction](https://medium.com/dyninno/dyninnos-incident-management-an-introduction-a4516b910269): Improving incident management is a cultural and business problem. You have to get leaders to agree it's worth it and to invest energy from the team. Somebody should really own the improvement of it and the ongoing care necessary. Dyninno has a dedicated team for this. Incident response is about effectively detecting and fixing issues (turn the lights back on) and ensuring the process is healthy and followed and that improvement happens by following through on learnings (transparency and improvement). 
* [Streamlining and Implementing Incident Management at Dyninno](https://medium.com/dyninno/streamlining-and-implementing-incident-management-at-dyninno-c8ea06327f3a): Their ticketing system became a central hub to drive incident response. Severities are determined by number of impacted customers. This is captured in a ticket when an issue is detected (can be by customer complaint or monitoring platform). Other automation looks for new tickets and severities and triggers internal instant messaging flows as determined by their severity scale. Still more tools are watching updates to an incident ticket made by the commander while it is being worked. I have never thought of the ticketing system as being the hub but it's a neat idea. The issue tracker does need a resonable api I guess but this seems to be less of an issue.
