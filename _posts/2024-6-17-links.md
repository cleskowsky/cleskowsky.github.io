title:  "Week 25: google cloud gcp production incident postmortem, slack k8s kubernetes deployer"
---

* [Sharing details on a recent incident impacting one of our customers](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure/details-of-google-cloud-gcve-incident/): GCP deleted a platform user's account and all related resources and backups in this incident. Every production support person's nightmare ...
* [Advanced Rollout Techniques: Custom Strategies for Stateful Apps in Kubernetes](https://slack.engineering/kube-stateful-rollouts/): Slack implements a custom k8s operator to automate percent based rollouts. Neat slack progress notification by their deployer. They have an incredibly large system of course. Not directly relatable to my day-to-day but an interesting read that gets into the motivating factor for this work and a few bumps along the way. That general technical project workflow feels very familiar. :)
