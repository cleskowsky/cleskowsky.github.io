title:  "Links Devoxx James Gosling IOT talk"
---

* [IoT in the Trenches, at Scale by James Gosling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NtrF_SiFQag): Interesting chat about the kinds of problems greengrass solves related to small devices, remotely placed in less than ideal conditions. Over the air updates, shoddy networks, monitoring, security, etc
* [The Demanding Work of Analyzing Incidents](https://ferd.ca/the-demanding-work-of-analyzing-incidents.html): Trying to tease out the interesting parts of an incident is hard. It's easy to get caught in the weeds, to write too much or dig too much into something that turns out to be not super interesting or matters in the grand scheme of things. Tedious is a word that is used and it's true. It's not easy to setup enough context and information for a group while also trying not to influence the outcome or decide on actions items for the team. Letting everyone talk, learn and figure out the important bits is the goal.
