* [Eric Wastl â€“ Advent of Code: Behind the Scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_oNOTknRTSU): Neat talk about how Eric makes advent of code. I give it a try every year. :)
* [Quick takes on the latest Cloudflare public incident write-up](https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2024/11/28/quick-takes-on-the-latest-cloudflare-public-incident-write-up/): Fail safes and safeties can be sources of risk in a system sometimes. Also a failsafe that is designed to work today under today's limits and constraints may not work tomorrow it sounds like.
* [How decentralized is Bluesky really?](https://oceanmd.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/SECOPS/boards/5?issueParent=37521&quickFilter=20): Nice read about the architecture of bluesky. Seems to be heading in the direction of twitter. VC backed, very expensive to run, how long is it going to be around realistically and what's it going to look like? Certainly much needed for right now.
* [DSQL Vignette: Aurora DSQL, and A Personal Story](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2024/12/03/aurora-dsql.html): New sql database from aws announced at reinvent. Postgres compatability, ACID properties, distributed storage / operation across regions with good performance.
