* "Software defined network spanning physical sites using wireguard with strong user auth"

> Tailscale is an app that creates a flexible and easy-to-use software-defined network on top of the fast and secure WireGuard protocol. I have my own network that I can access from anywhere in the world. This network allows me to connect to any device Iâ€™ve joined, with a granular access control list (ACL) that lets me decide which devices can see and access specific resources.
