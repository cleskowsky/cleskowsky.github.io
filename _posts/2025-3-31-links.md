* [Do you *really* need to store all that telemetry?](https://blog.bitdrift.io/post/do-you-need-to-store-that-telemetry): Very interesting read. It's very true that telemetry leaving a process becomes expensive and that monitoring vendors rely on us indiscriminately generating copious amounts of monitoring data we'll never look at in order to remain viable. Is this a reasonable alternative ... ??
* [Reliability Pillar - AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/reliability-pillar/welcome.html): Re-read of the reliability well-architected pillar by AWS. Good advice in here regardless of where my workload is running.
* [Charles Webster, Customer Enterprise Architect](https://people.zsa.io/charles-webster/): Interesting ZSA profile fellow who's got a sysadmin background and likes several neat cli tools.
* [JDK 24 G1/Parallel/Serial GC changes](https://tschatzl.github.io/2025/04/01/jdk24-g1-serial-parallel-gc-changes.html): Some notes about gc in Java 25. Nice incremental improvement to the g1 gc collector. Such a beautiful, thoughtful piece of tech.
* [One or Two? How Many Queues?](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/03/25/two-queues.html): There is a risk of a subset of specialized work being delayed unnecessarily due to the appearance of business elsewhere in a work queue system it sounds like.
