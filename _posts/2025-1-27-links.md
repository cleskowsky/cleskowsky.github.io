* [Load balancing Amazon ECS services with a Kubernetes Ingress Controller style approach](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/load-balancing-amazon-ecs-services-with-a-kubernetes-ingress-controller-style-approach/): Edge architecture that uses an nlb in front of nginx. We're considering doing something similar with Traefik at work.
* [Restructuring How We Think About Alerts](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/restructuring-how-we-think-about-alerts): Prefer informational alerts that don't try to tell you what the problem is. You will always have to investigate and if the guidance from an alert is wrong you've spent time looking into the wrong problem.
* [The Most Important Developer Productivity Metric](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/most-important-developer-productivity-metric-build-times): Time to build a package a deployable unit is an important metric. The longer it takes to build the harder it is to debug a production issue sometimes. More than 10m starts to feel bad.
* [Slack Audit Logs and Anomalies](https://slack.engineering/slack-audit-logs-and-anomalies/): Audit logging at slack + security event monitoring at the application level.
  * ![Sample audit log from Slack](/assets/2025/sample_audit_log_slack.png)
* [AI Mistakes Are Very Different from Human Mistakes](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/01/ai-mistakes-are-very-different-from-human-mistakes.html): Essay from Bruce Schneier about LLMs and how they aren't like people when they mess up. They lie confidently and are seemingly unaware of the boundaries of their competence.
