* [Ingestion delays @ Honeycomb](https://status.honeycomb.io/incidents/c5v7075wgtd7?ck_subscriber_id=512830353): This was a nasty outage. 9hr of at least partial failure and lost writes :'(. Investigation is ongoing. It sounds like they hit a limit of what a single ingest node could do workwise which caused a failure and restart such that other nodes failed as part of a chain reaction?
