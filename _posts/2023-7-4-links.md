title: "Links: http1.1/2/3 connection keep-alive"
---

Reading a bit about turning this on at work. It's mostly great for performance allegedly except when it isn't.

* [Connection MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Connection): Only valid for 1.0 and 1.1. Http2/3 ignore it since connection reuse is designed right into the protocol.
* [Persistent Connections java8](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/net/http-keepalive.html): A keepAlive cache is maintained transparently to a program. You can call close() on a connection operating in keepAlive mode to have it returned to a pool of connections to specific targets until they expire. You don't have to call close though. When a response is read fully, that's another signal to park the connection. (Content-length, and chunk transfer encoding give enough info do to this)
* [HTTP Keepalive Connections and Web Performance](https://www.nginx.com/blog/http-keepalives-and-web-performance/): Nginx is good at maintaining many keepAlive connections among other things. Httpd's event mpm is the best we thing we can do with the server we use at work. Pre-fork can be pretty terrible.
