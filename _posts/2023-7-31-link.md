title:  "Links: honeycomb outage"
---

* [Querying & Ingest outage](https://status.honeycomb.io/incidents/fp0zjwwpp8bw): Recent response team external communication log from Honeycomb. The transparency is great and frequency of updates good too while they were working the problem and weren't sure what was happening.
* [Adventures in Garbage Collection: Improving GC Performance in our Massive Monolith](https://shopify.engineering/adventures-in-garbage-collection?ck_subscriber_id=185275687): Gc performance tuning to improve tail latency in the system. I've been looking at java gc recently so this was near and dear to my heart. Java gc concepts are similar - young / old gen, mark and sweep, stop the world, major / minor collections. Good insights here.
