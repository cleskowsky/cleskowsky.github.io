* [Big Data is Dead](https://motherduck.com/blog/big-data-is-dead/): Most problems are not big data
  problems even in analytics. Usually we want to report over a near term batch of data. More rarely
  than that a broader report. None of these use cases have low latency constraints. And there's a
  potential legal liability to keeping data around too.
* [No Time to Do It All! Approaching Overload on DevOps Teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIWz619iXn0): How do you
  know you're experiencing overload or is there just a lot of stuff going on?
    * Ways of addressing overload
        * Shed load
        * Reduce thoroughness of results
        * Recruit resources
        * Shift work in time
* [Google threat intelligence group report 2024](https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2024-zero-day-trends): Data about who's attacking end users and enterprise users of the internet and how. Interesting trend away from end users and towards enterprise as the former is getting better at adopting security controls and better development practice / memory safe languages. Enterprise attacks seem to target networking and security appliances with code bases that are not based on modern tooling. (Memory used-after-free type errors stood out which makes me think of c/c++.)
