---

* [Make better documents.](https://www.anildash.com//2024/03/10/make-better-documents/): A roundup of things to keep in mind when writing a professional document. (Or any kind of doc?) Empathy for the reader, eliminating distractions and sequencing are my biggest takeaways personally
* [Single-Space Challenge: Trying to Manage My macOS Windows All in One Virtual Desktop ](https://www.macstories.net/stories/single-space-challenge-trying-to-manage-my-macos-windows-all-in-one-virtual-desktop/): I use 2 spaces myself - 1 for apple music and a few other things I don't look at all that often but should be open and another for my main work screen. I'm almost here. The "placing windows with intention" thing is not something I do.  I'll try that! :) 
* [Trunk-based development](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration/trunk-based-development): We're thinking about a move to git and bitbucket at work. Starting to read up on it.
* [BitBucket Setup - multiple Workspaces?](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/comments/vw9yj2/bitbucket_setup_multiple_workspaces/): How many workspaces do we need?
* [The UX of UUIDs](https://unkey.dev/blog/uuid-ux): How to make uuids easier to work with and think about when you see them in code and systems.
* [How we ensure Cloudflare customers aren't affected by Let's Encrypt's certificate chain change](https://blog.cloudflare.com/shortening-lets-encrypt-change-of-trust-no-impact-to-cloudflare-customers): Let's encrypt root cert expiry and cloudflare's decision to stop using le to sign new certificates.
* [Unit Tests Considered Harmful](https://www.shaiyallin.com/post/unit-tests-considered-harmful): These days I feel like integration testing (without mocks and stubs) probably gets me the most bang for energy I put into testing. e2e testing is great too but hard. Units also have their place. The testing trophy is mightier than the pyramid ... :)
* [The Playdate Story: What Was it Like to Make Handheld Video Game System Hardware?](https://gdcvault.com/play/1034707/The-Playdate-Story-What-Was): Great talk at gdc this year by Cabel Sasser about the Playdate handheld made by panic.
