* [Make better documents.](https://www.anildash.com//2024/03/10/make-better-documents/): A roundup of things to keep in mind when writing a professional document. (Or any kind of doc?) Empathy for the reader, eliminating distractions and sequencing are my biggest takeaways personally
* [Single-Space Challenge: Trying to Manage My macOS Windows All in One Virtual Desktop ](https://www.macstories.net/stories/single-space-challenge-trying-to-manage-my-macos-windows-all-in-one-virtual-desktop/): I use 2 spaces myself - 1 for apple music and a few other things I don't look at all that often but should be open and another for my main work screen. I'm almost here. The "placing windows with intention" thing is not something I do.  I'll try that! :)
