* [Tim Sweeney: Fortnite, Unreal Engine, and the Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc): Great, loong chat with Tim Sweeney about Epic, Unreal and the ecosystem of tools he got started and how he thinks about the future!
* [Platform_Engineering_Craft25 slides, Adrian Cockcroft](https://github.com/adrianco/slides/blob/master/Platform_Engineering_Craft25.pdf): Platforms should serve business needs of moving faster, or delivering something a uesr needs. Platforms need product management love to make sure they're evolving in a prioritized way and that engineers building them know what who the customer is and what they need.
* [Sidekiq idempotent jobs](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/sidekiq/idempotent_jobs/): Neat thinking about background jobs and handling duplicate
  * Try to be idempotent
  * Gitlab uses redis to prevent duplicate jobs - a lock is taken when a job is enqueued
  * 2 policies for preventing the same job entering processing more than once
    * Lock is taken when a task is enqueued and released "when running" or "when finished"
  * They put TTLs on job locks in redis just in case a job doesn't properly run or release a lock
* [Best practices for connecting Amazon ECS services in a VPC: Using an internal load balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/networking-connecting-services.html#networking-connecting-services-elb): This is how we're setup to do it at work with a shared network load balancer.
* [Jenkins.io terraform code](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/azure): Neat public repository of infrastructure terraform code for public jenkins server at jenkins.io
    * [Github repo: jenkinsio-terraform](https://github.com/cleskowsky/jenkinsio-terraform)

# Jenkins

```groovy

// Jenkinsfile from aws-sdk jenkins plugin
// Very simple call to a library function (sharedlib?)
// Looks like our buildApp function at work but
// also returns a pipeline definition
//
// Good validation of the idea

buildPlugin(useContainerAgent: true, configurations: [
        [platform: 'linux', jdk: 21],
        [platform: 'windows', jdk: 17],
])
```

* [Jenkins project ci build bot](https://ci.jenkins.io/): Lots of interesting looking documentation linked here. Love the documentation of the build system and to organization around this project. I have some reading to do! :)
