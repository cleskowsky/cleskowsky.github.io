* [Tim Sweeney: Fortnite, Unreal Engine, and the Future of Gaming | Lex Fridman Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=477qF6QNSvc): Great, loong chat with Tim Sweeney about Epic, Unreal and the ecosystem of tools he got started and how he thinks about the future!
* [Platform_Engineering_Craft25 slides, Adrian Cockcroft](https://github.com/adrianco/slides/blob/master/Platform_Engineering_Craft25.pdf): Platforms should serve business needs of moving faster, or delivering something a uesr needs. Platforms need product management love to make sure they're evolving in a prioritized way and that engineers building them know what who the customer is and what they need.

# Jenkins

```groovy

// Jenkinsfile from aws-sdk jenkins plugin
// Very simple call to a library function (sharedlib?)
// Looks like our buildApp function at work but
// also returns a pipeline definition
//
// Good validation of the idea

buildPlugin(useContainerAgent: true, configurations: [
        [platform: 'linux', jdk: 21],
        [platform: 'windows', jdk: 17],
])
```

* [Jenkins project ci build bot](https://ci.jenkins.io/): Lots of interesting looking documentation linked here. Love the documentation of the build system and to organization around this project. I have some reading to do! :)
