* [How JVM handles exceptions](https://foojay.io/today/how-jvm-handles-exceptions/): Great level of detail for a reminder of how exception handling works in the jvm.
  * An exception is thrown from a method that is guarded by try-catch-finally
  * A table for each such method with such a guard is constructed by the jvm
  * When an exception is thrown, control passes to a catch block if there is one for the specific exception type
  * Whether or not a catch is found, control passes to finally
  * When no suitable exception handler is found in the lookup table and after finally, control is passed up the stack to the last frame / method context to repeat a handler search
  * When no handler can be found, the thread where the exception occurred it torn down and a stack trace is printed
* [Goodbye integers. Hello UUIDv7!](https://buildkite.com/resources/blog/goodbye-integers-hello-uuids/): I never thought about the impact of non-sequential primary keys on db performance. (Reads and writes!) Cache locality for keys with random prefixes isn't great which makes sense. A new uuid standard - v7 - uses unix timestamp as a key prefix rather than randomness.
* [How Tailscale works](https://tailscale.com/blog/how-tailscale-works): Tailscale sounds amazing for creating a network over devices that are on different public / private networks! Will have to try it out. :)
