* [Attaching Values to Java Enum](https://www.baeldung.com/java-enum-values): Good example of how to create an enum type.
  * [I didn't write any Javascript, and other shortcuts](https://csvbase.com/blog/4): A useful website. Tastefully designed. Without react or vue or much javascript to speak of at all. HTML5, and css ftw. :)
