* [In defense of linked lists](http://antirez.com/news/138): A quickie about linked lists and how delightfully simple and versatile they can be. It's one of the first data structures I really dug into in my career for sure. I have found in 99% of my career I have used lists or hashes for my in process stateful storage needs. :)
* Some links about mastodon I've read recently. I'm thinking about jumping in but am finding myself paralyzed by choice of starting server which many people say you shouldn't worry about since you can move. Sigh.
