# Building production-ready prototypes

- Questions to ask when prototyping
    - Who is the customer?
    - What is the problem?
    - What is the most important customer benefit?
    - How do we know what the customer needs?
    - What do we want the experience to look like?
- These questions feed into 2 docs: Press release (As if they've done the thing ... up front), FAQ
- Don't skimp on security !!

# How Amazon migrated a large ecommerce platform to AWS Graviton

- Big perf bump going from graviton -> graviton2
- Much better perf/watt (Better for environment + sustainability)
- This is a really neat arm processor. Goes through stats
  - 4x as many cores (64 vcpus)
  - Coherent caches
  - Per vcpu caches (64kb l1, 1mb l2)
  - Fast interconnect within processor (2tb bisection bandwidth)
- 2nd half was a case study from a team in amazon (the ecommerce side) that migrated to graviton2.
  - Bit of pain here I think because they were going from intel -> arm and they were working I guess with an older stack with dependencies that weren't arm compatible
  - Had to choose between upgrading things or dropping / replacing things as well as backwards compatibility! (They were a platform team with services used by many other teams @ Amazon. ie You can't just go deleting things ...)
