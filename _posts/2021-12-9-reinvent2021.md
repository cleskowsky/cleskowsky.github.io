# Building production-ready prototypes

- Questions to ask when prototyping
    - Who is the customer?
    - What is the problem?
    - What is the most important customer benefit?
    - How do we know what the customer needs?
    - What do we want the experience to look like?
- These questions feed into 2 docs: Press release (As if they've done the thing ... up front), FAQ
- Don't skimp on security !!
