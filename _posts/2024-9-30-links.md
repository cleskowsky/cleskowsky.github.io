* [Thoughts From The First SEV0 Conference](https://certomodo.substack.com/p/thoughts-from-the-first-sev0-conference): Nice rundown of what sounds like an interesting conference. Can't wait for the videos. Possibly my fave description was an incident response exercise @ slack where a lunch order was screwed up and the participants had to work the problem! lol

* [sync_pd_slack_oncall.py](https://gist.github.com/ferd/19b0207bfc10173559e523c049db51db): Nice example of a short python script that is well documented that interacts with pagerduty and slack from Honeycomb. :)

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER
# IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN
# CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

# Dependencies:
#
# The script expects to find two API Keys:
#
# - a Slack Bot User OAuth Token's key with the following permissions:
#   - "usergroups:read",
#   - "usergroups:write",
#   - "users.profile:read",
#   - "users:read",
#   - "users:read.email"
# - a PagerDuty read-only HTTP API key
#
# The keys are to be located in text files at:
#
#  - $SYNC_SECRETS_PATH/$ENV.pagerduty_readonly
#  - $SYNC_SECRETS_PATH/$ENV.slack_groupsync
#
# The default value for $SYNC_SECRETS_PATH is /mnt/secrets-store
# and for $ENV is 'development'. Override them as you see fit for
# your container environment.

# Setup:
# 
# There's no database or nothing of this kind. Scroll down the file and edit the
# NOOP_USERS list to contain the list of any PagerDuty users you have that act
# as placeholders and can't be in slack groups.
# 
# Then edit the ROTATIONS dict to map the slack group handle to one or more
# rotations in PagerDuty.
# 
# We run this script in a Kubernetes cronjob in EKS where the secrets are
# managed and mounted via the AWS provider for the Secrets Store CSI Driver.
# Getting this set up is left as an exercise to the reader.

# Usage:
#
# $ ./sync_pd_slack_oncall.py
#
# Notes:
#  - It is expected that all rotations and group aliases are valid
#    and already exist. No error handling is done.
#  - If any rotation contains only NO-OP users, it won't be updated
#    as Slack does not allow empty groups.
#  - There's no rate limiting nor retries. Our setup is small enough
#    that none is required yet.
