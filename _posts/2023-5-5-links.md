* [Scaling up the Prime Video audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90%](https://www.primevideotech.com/video-streaming/scaling-up-the-prime-video-audio-video-monitoring-service-and-reducing-costs-by-90): Serverless is not always the best way to build a system. Thoughtful reflection about why they did that to start with, and then why they changed their minds.
* [SREcon23 Americas - The Endgame of SRE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEs6j-BOl20): A team that is asked to do more than they are comfortably able to handle lands in an incident. Talks about some of the reasons that can happen. How to get from an incident to learning and growth. The importance of communication. Understanding. Blameless so that people always feel safe, and we're able to learn about our systems. Enjoyed this talk.
* [JEP 450: Compact Object Headers (Experimental)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/450): Less interested in the specific content here and more about the general structure of the RFC / 1 pager. I like it!
