title:  "Links: incident response planning practice, metrics"

* [Incident Management Steps and Best Practices](https://www.honeycomb.io/incident-management-best-practices): Good high level refresher of what incident response planning should include.
* [Counting Forest Fires: Incident Response Metrics](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/counting-forest-fires): "You don't evaluate how good a fire crew was by counting the number of fires there were this year and comparing with last." Which metrics you track matter. Count stuff you can do, not can't.
  * Can try to prevent harm to responders
  * Can learn from an incident
  * Can't prevent incidents (Not a good goal. Handling incidents makes the system better.)
