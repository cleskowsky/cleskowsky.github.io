* [AWS lets you setup reverse dns on elastic ips](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2021/09/dns-elastic-ip-addresses-virtual-private-cloud/): This is very important for ips that send email. (It's a strong signal for deliverability.) And here's the [documenation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#Using_Elastic_Addressing_Reverse_DNS).
* [An A11y (Accessibility) checklist](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/): Emily shared this the other day. Fantastic checklist-style resource where each recommendation links to more detailed information related to it. Very well put together!
* [Oxide Computers hiring kit](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xtofg-fMQfZoq8Y3oSAKjEgDQCRHx-GMSmPcxdEea4A/edit): Oxide shared part of their hiring process and the values they're looking for. I love stuff like this. Food for thought in here. :)
