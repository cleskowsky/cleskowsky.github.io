* [Planning for change with RFCs](https://increment.com/planning/planning-with-requests-for-comments/): Added a section to my "How I work" section for some of the ideas here. An open, writing heavy process to think through big-ish changes fits really well with the way I think about work.
* [Wikipedia at 25: What the web can be](https://www.anildash.com/2026/01/15/wikipedia-at-25/): Wikipedia is on of the most incredible resources of knowledge that came up in our generation and there are people who would tear it down for self serving reasons. Gross.
* [Creating a Discord Bot with Discord4J + Spring Boot](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-discord4j-bot): Example of structing code for a Discord bot that includes the spring dependency injection container and a way to deliver messages to handlers that doesn't hardcode them.
