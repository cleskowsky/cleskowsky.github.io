* [Current life in Tokyo](https://www.ausnog.net/sites/default/files/ausnog-05/presentations/ausnog-05-d01p03-tomoya-yoshida-ntt.pdf): Lots of detail about the event, it's impact, how they recovered, and how Japan will prepare for the next one. Very well put together.
* [The cloud under the sea](https://www.theverge.com/c/24070570/internet-cables-undersea-deep-repair-ships): Story on the Verge about how the undersea fibre optic cable network is built and maintained. I have heard nothing about this ever in my life ...
* [Real Talk: What We Think We Know — That Just Ain’t So](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon24americas/presentation/allspaw): John Allspaw talks about misconceptions in incident response type work.
* [Why is observability so expensive?](https://mattklein123.dev/2024/04/03/observability-cost-crisis/): Any source that emits a metric or a log is triggering a process that collects, ingest, stores and analyzes that output. This is a cost that can't be avoided. Our systems emit a lot of data by design just in the offhand chance that we'll need it later. Microservices may have exacerbated this problem ...
* [NASA’s Voyager 1 Resumes Sending Engineering Updates to Earth](https://blogs.nasa.gov/voyager/2024/04/22/nasas-voyager-1-resumes-sending-engineering-updates-to-earth/): H/w fault is correct by jpl team on voyager spacecraft. Latency to the craft is 22h 1-way with the round trip being 44hr. That's one heck of a feedback loop. :)
