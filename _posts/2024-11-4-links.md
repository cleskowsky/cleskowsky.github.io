* [cmd/lopower/lopower.go](https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/lp/cmd/lopower/lopower.go): Bit of code to connect a low powered device to tailscale with wireguard. (Smaller than their usual agent that does this because those devices aren't usually very big)

* [Disaggregated Storage - a brief introduction](https://avi.im/blag/2024/disaggregated-storage/): Using a remote disk is a choice some databases make that can have benefits. Compute can be added / removed very quickly for query processing and other frontend tasks. There are pros and cons of course. Extended latency when getting a db page since that now involves a network call for example.

* [Shifting from Observability 1.0 to 2.0 with Charity Majors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVpQeMDWysA): Cloudwatch logs and metrics is surprisingly expensive. Obs2.0 question: How many systems do you have to look at to understand what your system is doing?

* [Monitoring best practices with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis using Amazon CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/monitoring-best-practices-with-amazon-elasticache-for-redis-using-amazon-cloudwatch/): Key redis metrics as identified by aws and sent to cloudwatch from elasticache

* [Solid Cache: A new disk-backed ActiveRecord::Cache::Store. Bigger, cheaper, faster.](https://dev.37signals.com/solid-cache/): Rails 8 is using this as a default causing with sqlite to get started. Sounds like a great idea.

* [The radiating programmer](https://dev.37signals.com/the-radiating-programmer/): Recently at work we've found that daily standups aren't bringing us joy. Invasive and often disruptive to a problem we're in the middle of dealing with. We switch to more formal check-ins once a week where we write down what we've been up to as well as a lively slack channel of activity throughout the week asking questions and getting feedback.

* [Userland Disk I/O](https://transactional.blog/how-to-learn/disk-io): Talks about different methods of getting data from an application to disk in linux some of which skip the kernel page cache.
* [The State of Online Schema Migrations in MySQL](https://planetscale.com/blog/state-of-online-schema-migrations-in-mysql): Migrating data is hard.
