* [Amazon EBS now provides visibility into EBS volume initialization status](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/07/amazon-ebs-visibility-volume-initialization-status/): Visibility into the snapshot restore-to-volume warming process for large ebs volumes. This seems kinda nice. Getting to a usable volume after requesting a restore can take a long time.
