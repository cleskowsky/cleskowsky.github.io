* [Amazon EBS now provides visibility into EBS volume initialization status](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2025/07/amazon-ebs-visibility-volume-initialization-status/): Visibility into the snapshot restore-to-volume warming process for large ebs volumes. This seems kinda nice. Getting to a usable volume after requesting a restore can take a long time.
* [Proven Practices for Succeeding with a Multicloud Strategy](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/proven-practices-for-succeeding-with-a-multicloud-strategy/?): Solid multi-cloud strategy advice.
* [De-cloud and de-k8s â€” bringing our apps back home](https://dev.37signals.com/bringing-our-apps-back-home/): 6 weeks to move their first app onto a private cloud they setup after deciding to leave aws. That's really good.
