* [Speedup Your Code Through Asynchronous Programing](https://www.p99conf.io/session/speedup-your-code-through-asynchronous-programing/): I would not have defined asynchronous programming the way she has but the more I think about it the more sense it makes. Multiple things happening at once -> async, one thing at a time -> sync. I would have called this parallelism or single / multi-threaded design. Background tasks or work that happens outside the scope of user level tasks is another way I think about it I guess. She has a nice framing I like. :) Also there is a javascript book reference I found in this talk I'd like to read a bit more
