Working with the ops team to identify and mitigate risk from log4j2 currently along with many others around the world. Log4j is pretty fundamental to how java applications do logging these days that you're either using it directly if you're running a jvm or are using something else that depends on it so you're exposed anyways.

We are definitely users of log4j but thankfully not the feature that is the source of risk here. Anyways I'll be keeping a post here with notes about what we're doing as part of our response.

Our general strategy so far:

- Identify risk in our applications
- Patch systems as necessary
- Widen the net to investigate how 3rd party tools and software are responding to the bug

We're going to post a support bulletin letting customers know we're on it and to provide a status update. Here are some examples of companies starting to do that:
