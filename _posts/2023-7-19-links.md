title: "Links: sizing a mongodb cluster"
---

* [MongoDB Sizing Guide](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/mongodb-sizing-guide-sepp-renfer/): Good, empirical advice on how to come to an approximate sizing for a new cluster if you have a sense of how much data you're going to be storing.
* [Handling exceptions in spring mvc](https://spring.io/blog/2013/11/01/exception-handling-in-spring-mvc): Write an exception and tag it with an annotation include status and error message. This is pretty damn elegant. If you can figure the magic! :)
* [Managing to Your SLO Amidst Chaos • Liz Fong-Jones • YOW! 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oxmk-DiLrNA): Techtalk from Liz about how to move quickly in a small team, ship, and be reliable
  * be deploying always (multiple times a day)
  * 2mil data points ingested per second
  * ask first what is the expected amount of reliability from customers which helps a team set service level objectives (slos)
    * Measure critical user journeys and determine which % need to complete successful for user expectations to be met
  * alert based on slos primarily gives a good sense of how the system is performing (directly relates to customer pain)
  * honeycomb slos
    * homepage loads fast (99.99% of events process without error over 30 days)
    * query runs fast (99.99% of events process without error over 30 days)
    * ingest happens fast (99.99% of events are ingested in under 5ms over 30 days)
    * means ~4.5mins of violation a month
  * feature flags
  * devs ship when work is done not x days in the future when they really know how the thing they just wrote is supposed to work
