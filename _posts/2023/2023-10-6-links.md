* [A day in the life of a deaf child](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/molly-glass_i-wanted-to-share-what-a-day-in-the-life-activity-7112961061598715904-5XMR/): This was hard to read. I've never thought about what it must be like to be challenged in this way. I take everything I am able to do and experience completely for granted.

> I wanted to share what a day in the life is like as a Deaf kid. I’ve been deaf since 18 months old. Profound bilateral loss. My parents were told I had less than 5% residual hearing in my right ear that would be progressively lost. I did not get my first hearing aid until I was 5 years old. My parents couldn’t afford it. My grandpa paid for it. Ah…the 80’s.
