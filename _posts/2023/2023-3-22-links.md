* [Keeping humans in the loop](https://cursedquail.com/blog/2023-03.humans-in-the-loop/): A reminder that the systems we work around need people to help operate them and better understand why they're behaving the way they are especially during periods of unusual activity. Consider how to design a touch point, or a monitoring view with people in mind. (Users and operators) This is often an iterative thing. Do something that's a step in the right direction, listen for feedback about how well it worked, then make it better.
* [The Hardest Part of Writing Tests is Getting Started](https://shopify.engineering/the-hardest-part-of-writing-tests-is-getting-started): How to get started writing an automated test suite.
  * Write a test, any test (true == true)
  * Test the easy things (isolated functions)
  * Stub out collaborating classes
  * Write end to end tests
* [How discord stores trillions of messages](https://discord.com/blog/how-discord-stores-trillions-of-messages): So much traffic. I can't imagine running a cassandra cluster this big. Interesting how the switch to scylladb helped as much as it did.
