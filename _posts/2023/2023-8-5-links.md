* [Teach Yourself Programming in Ten Years](https://norvig.com/21-days.html): Becoming really good at something takes time and intention. (References deliberate practice.)
* [Three digital health tools to help combat clinic burnout](https://www.oceanmd.com/news/digital-health-tools-combat-clinic-burnout/): Online booking, patient forms, and the referral network. All help streamline (and make safer) interactions between health clinics and their patients.
* [OceanMD is 10 years old](https://www.oceanmd.com/news/introducing-oceanmd/): We're having a positive impact on healthcare in the province, and recently, the rest of Canada too.
* [Revolutionizing Patient Care: Nova Scotiaâ€™s Strategic Move to eReferrals](https://www.oceanmd.com/news/nova-scotia-ereferral-update/): Amazing!
* [The "Just In Time" Theory of User Behavior](https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-just-in-time-theory/): A helpful hint delivered inline at just the right moment is better than many pages of documentation that very few people will ever read. Tangential idea: make it easy to do the right thing, hard to do the wrong thing when designing an interaction.
* [Fantasy Meets Reality](https://cabel.com/2023/07/30/fantasy-meets-reality/): Remember when you're designing your next amazing thing that somewhere down the line a human might have to use it and take that into account when you think about affordances and safety. :)
