title: "Ocean eReferrals in Nova Scotia"
---

The software my company makes is used by family doctors and other healthcare providers to send referrals for patients in need of specialist care. These requests are sent by fax now which lacks transparency in terms of whether a clinic has seen a request and where they're at in terms of processing it. (eg By booking an appointment with a patient.)

Happy to be part of a team that is trying to improve this aspect of our healthcare system in Canada.
