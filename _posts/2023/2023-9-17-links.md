* [How to Extract the Maximum Value From Logs](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-extract-the-maximum-value-from-logs?ck_subscriber_id=185275687): Good general advice and things to think about when coming up with a logging strategy. Logs have been very important to me in the systems I've been tasked with keeping healthy.
* [Tech Blog: Create Meaningful Logging](https://medium.com/@andrian.gandawida/tech-blog-create-meaningful-logging-555265bac1fb): Another logging link this morning. Even with practical advice. :)
* [Surprising Scalability of Multitenancy](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2023/03/23/economics.html): Have to think about this one more. Multi-tenancy brings system peak usage and the average closer together for better utilization. A system often has many different kinds of workloads: cron, synchronous (user requests), async (background jobs triggered by users or something else in the system), reporting functions, etc. Some are more expensive to process than others. If their arrival varies in time well enough (uncorrelated workloads) there's a good chance you can share resources. (Cpu fairly readily, memory less so but still there are opportunities here!) Very cool read. :)
* [Honk activitypub implementation notes](https://humungus.tedunangst.com/r/honk/m/activitypub.7): Documented choices about what bits of the activitypub spec have been implemented. Part of the repository for a small ap server. Naming is unusual. :)
