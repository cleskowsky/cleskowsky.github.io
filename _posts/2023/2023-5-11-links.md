* [CoPilot Review: My Thoughts After 6 Months](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDd71IUIgpg): Short video from The Primeagen talking about his experience using this code authoring assistant. Can help with boilerplate. Makes mistakes. Not recommended for juniors who should probably just write code and get a sense of where bugs may appear and how to read code critically. (Generated code can get glossed over sometimes.)
* [Marital conflict video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CjVcr6Urmlz/?igshid=YTY2NzY3YTc%3D): This is my favourite video ever. I think the twerp is in behind and very upset by the bug having a treat without her. lolol
