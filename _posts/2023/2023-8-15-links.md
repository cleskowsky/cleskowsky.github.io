* [Observability at the Edge](https://medium.com/chick-fil-atech/observability-at-the-edge-b2385065ab6e): How do you monitor a system that is spread out geographically where quality of network and bandwidth aren't consistent? Chick-fil-A runs 2800+ kubernetes clusters - 1 per store. Each store is a compute edge. Metrics are shipped to a central analytics / alerting system. I like how they think about what to observe:
  * System metrics
  * Application metrics
  * Business metrics
