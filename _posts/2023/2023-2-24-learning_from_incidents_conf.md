# Charity Majors

* Lots of good ideas around the importance of debugging
* In production
* Instrumentation
* Setting yourself up to be able to handle unknown-unknowns
* Dashboards and alerts are about known-unknowns
* The importance of using modern tooling around systems

# Jessica Kerr

* Style guide no. Something people have to keep in their heads. Barrier to participation.
* Honeycomb doesn't use a template. Free form. People who were there help to piece together what happened and to help each other learn.
* Boundaries not uniformity
* If something needs done, someone's just going to do it
* "Don't take a tiny technical task and turn it into a social project. :) Bigger stuff is ticketed to be talked about with the team."
* Few procedures. Only as much process as absolutely necessary.
* "It's about people, and software, and the relationships between us."
