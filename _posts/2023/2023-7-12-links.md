* [Charity Majors - High-Performing Teams and Software Development Death Spiral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKBuEOaFiNQ): From the accelerate book, she talks about number of deploys per day as a key metric for how effective a team is at delivering value. Interesting idea from this is "if the last step in your deployment pipeline isn't deploy to some production or prod-like environment, the job failed". Your ability to spot a bug or weird behaviour goes off a cliff the further away you get from when new code was checked in.
