title: "Links: hash function avalanche murmur3"
---

* [Hashing](https://samwho.dev/hashing/): What are hash functions, where we use them and what are the useful properties of good ones. (murmur3 is a hash function I've never heard of before that has good spread of random values) The idea of avalanche effect was new - given an input and a hash function, how many bits are flipped in the output after hashing. murmur3 seemed to do around 50% on average. (Plus or minus a bit for a given input but overall 50%!) Also loved the interactive examples. This fellow spent much time on this learning resource. :)
