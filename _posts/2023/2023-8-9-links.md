* [Cloudflare speed test](https://speed.cloudflare.com/): An excellent internet speed test by cf.
* [Fulltext search is coming to mastodon](https://dotart.blog/dotart-blog/full-text-search-coming): This seems like a good thing.
* [Get a sense of scale for computer storage](https://m.leskowsky.net/@lproven@vivaldi.net/110837211017194755): Number of bytes compared to number of grains of rice. Bit incredible this.
