* [So You Want to Hire for Developer Tooling](https://hazelweakly.me/blog/so-you-want-to-hire-for-developer-tooling/): When to hire for a role like this, why, what sorts of problems they'll likely tackle, and what they shouldn't! It's going to be a role that doesn't have a lot of authority but will have to figure out how to get things done regardless. (Consensus builder.)
* [Keeping the Lights On: The On-Call Process that Works](https://thenewstack.io/keeping-the-lights-on-the-on-call-process-that-works/): Lots of good ideas in here. Tinybird's oncall isn't mandatory but is compensated. Alerts are evaluated regularly and unhelpful ones are fixed or eliminated. Every alert has a runbook! Developers are expected to help out during core hours.
