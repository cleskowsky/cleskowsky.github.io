* [Jepsen 15: What Even Are Transactions? by Kyle Kingsbury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecZp6cWhDjg): Jepsen findings shared for claims of transactional consistency by a few different db vendors. This stuff is hard. Have a few readings to take away from this.
* [Why Playwright is less flaky than Selenium](https://justin.searls.co/links/2024-08-29-why-playwright-is-less-flaky-than-selenium/): Premise seems to be playwright is faster than selenium. You're forced to write better tests that have fewer race conditions. I had my doubts about this when we switched to playwright at work, but I think this may be accurate.
* [Engineering with Empathy: My Journey to Understanding the User Experience](https://slack.engineering/engineering-with-empathy-my-journey-to-understanding-the-user-experience/): Love the personal goal to make better informed decisions about product. "Better understanding of users, their needs, and how they use your product." Stuff to be afraid of include becoming overly attached to a thing you built, and not speaking because you're intimidated or worried your question isn't a good one doesn't help you grow.
* [Chat oriented programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=CZGDhgcQL6I&si=5MUy99ANagrcL3B7): IDE completion agents haven't been super helpful to me. Mostly I get rid of whatever they suggest because it's not helpful. But the stuff I've been seeing where the interface to the llm is a chat window where you can have a bit of back and forth has been compelling lately.
