* [Jepsen 15: What Even Are Transactions? by Kyle Kingsbury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecZp6cWhDjg): Jepsen findings shared for claims of transactional consistency by a few different db vendors. This stuff is hard. Have a few readings to take away from this.
* [Why Playwright is less flaky than Selenium](https://justin.searls.co/links/2024-08-29-why-playwright-is-less-flaky-than-selenium/): Premise seems to be playwright is faster than selenium. You're forced to write better tests that have fewer race conditions. I had my doubts about this when we switched to playwright at work, but I think this may be accurate.
