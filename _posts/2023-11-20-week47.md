* [Data - The Land DevOps Forgot • Michael Nygard • YOW! 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=459-H33is6o): Applied devops themes to data analytics side of business. Nubank started I guess with a centralized data management team that ran systems but was often a go-between for subject matter experts when issues came up to a platform team. Pushed ownership / new responsibilities to other teams, created a platform that made easy things more straightforward with monitoring and other tools and centralized governance! Cool story. Big part of this transformation as with devops was bring hearts and minds along. This kind of change takes awhile.
