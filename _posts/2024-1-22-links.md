* [Wireless Aluminum Tenkeyless Keyboard - Space Gray](https://matias.store/products/fk408btb): Apple looking keyboard with larger arrow keys, dedicated page up page down, long battery life, and can pair with 3 devices.
* [SQLite or PostgreSQL? It's Complicated!](https://www.twilio.com/blog/sqlite-postgresql-complicated): The story of a program with state stored in sqlite. It worked for awhile, until the amount of data and number of users outgrew the initial system as designed and so it was migrated. Could it have been made more efficient? Unsure. Sqlite is an amazing little tool that's perfect for many applications. Postgres is pretty great too! :)
