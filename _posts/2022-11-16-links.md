* [Conway's Law](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ConwaysLaw.html): A system's design resembles the communication patterns of the teams that built it. Interesting idea is to structure teams working on the same system at the outset along the module boundaries you'd like to see / encourage. We can use the effect to advantage rather than just accept it's inevitable influence.
* [Six Coding Interview Formats to Replace LeetCode Bullshit](https://hoffm.medium.com/six-coding-interview-formats-to-replace-leetcode-84f3c770b5c1): This is nice. Much better than an algorithmic question + optimization. The idea is to do something that more closely resembles what people will do in work.
  * Solve a Problem with Code
  * Integrate with an API
  * Investigate a Bug (Failing test case?)
  * Write a Technical Proposal (take home)
  * Implement a Feature (give access to a codebase + a change spec, take home)
  * Review Code (comprehension, empathy, mentorship, constructive feedback, writing, judgement)
