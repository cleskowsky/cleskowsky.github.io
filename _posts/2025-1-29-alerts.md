* [Restructuring How We Think About Alerts](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/restructuring-how-we-think-about-alerts): Prefer informational alerts that don't try to tell you what the problem is. You will always have to investigate and if the guidance from an alert is wrong you've spent time looking into the wrong problem.
* [Against Incident Severities and in Favor of Incident Types](https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/against-incident-severities-favor-incident-types): Nice ideas here. Rather than just think about priorities and how to trigger incidents based on that - small, medium, large - also consider kind like security, internal, novel, isolated, etc. Re-framing this way lets us think about how to alert and where and even come up with subgroups of people to include that makes sense in context.
