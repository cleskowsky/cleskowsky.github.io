title: "Links: shoes walking, playwright github actions"
---

* [Tips for choosing walking shoes](https://www.health.harvard.edu/exercise-and-fitness/tips-for-choosing-walking-shoes): Carmen and I walk a lot. Thinking about our shoes is probably a good idea and this is a good reminder of that.
* [Mondoo Package Ansible Role](https://github.com/mondoohq/ansible-mondoo): Small, simple, ansible role that installs mondoo client on hosts that ansible can reach (ssh service running) and manage
* [Simmons: Mondoo Operations Exerciser](https://github.com/mondoohq/simmons): Ben Rockwood's production playwright end to end tester. Really cool, simple, zero cost production test runner . I love it! He can capture a browser video file as part of the test and upload it to github for storage. Also zero cost because their repo is public.
