* [How Cloudflareâ€™s systems dynamically route traffic across the globe](https://blog.cloudflare.com/meet-traffic-manager/): Make network routing changes for traffic between datacenters automatically to maintain a target latency for users. The system has to be aware of what capacity is available in a datacenter and neighbouring ones to make these decisions.

* [My approach to GTD and PKM](https://jmduke.com/posts/post/pkm-gtd-2024/): I like the 3 risks he calls out that he's worried about. Seems relevant to many of us:
  * Lots of things going on so I forget things
  * Lots of things in my head that I can't easily express in code or docs or elsewhere but that would be helpful if shared
  * Trap: Focus on short term easy wins over longer term harder work

* [Zero-overhead Container Networking with eBPF and Netkit](https://www.p99conf.io/session/zero-overhead-container-networking-with-ebpf-and-netkit/): Amazing work to bring container network performance (for high line rates eg 100Gb) in line with host networking. There used to be a virtual network adapter inside a container paired with one outside and 2 full network stacks - one inside and one outside the container. In kernel 6.6 egress traffic bypasses the host network stack with the help of ebpf programs and new netkit adapters. Neat stuff! :)

* [Enhancing P99 Latency: Strategies for Doubling/Tripling Performance in Third-Party APIs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWZlmlAxr1c): TLS1.3 for fewer roundtrips during connection establishment, http2 for connection multiplexing and async dns lookups. Told a few stories about the kinds of problems they encountered communicating with 3rd party apis @ uber. With enough api usage, small-ish sounding things can make a big difference.
