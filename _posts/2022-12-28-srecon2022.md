# Disaster recovery testing @ Booking.com

* [Youtube](https://www.usenix.org/conference/srecon22emea/presentation/fouquet)
* Booking.com first disaster recovery test - Evacuate traffic out of a region. Started by getting everybody together and asking about how to do it and what would happen.
* Failover testing
* Goal 1: Full business continuity with the loss of a region
* Challenges
    * Risk
    * Cost
    * Buy in
    * Investment
* Growing the program
    * Roadmapping
    * Wider communication across teams
    * Visibility
    * Risk management
    * Cross functional collaboration from management to front line workers
* We’re “inducing an outage”. Everybody should understand this!
* The first time this happened there was lots of manual work, people, time. After there is a postmortem. Issues are fixed. Services are made more similar in terms of safety controls. A subsequent test is schedule with greater risk.
* Ongoing process of training the broader team. Awareness of runbooks - where they are and how to use them.
* Different degrees of “small” incidents
    * Network isolation (some risk)
    * Region isolation (more risk)
    * DC power failure (lots of risk, abort test is hard. Once you pull the plug you have to turn it all back on. Restarting things can be tricky)
