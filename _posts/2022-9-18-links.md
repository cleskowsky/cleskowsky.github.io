* [Github actions performance re-architecture](https://github.blog/2022-09-16-how-we-tripled-max-concurrent-jobs-to-boost-performance-of-github-actions/): This is great. 3 great finds they learned about by reviewing traces of work in motion. There was a domain object in the system that contained a growing list of smaller ones that were being stored together document style that was unpacked. That's something we find sometimes on the mongodb side of life since modelling there encourages this kind of packing for locality and avoiding costly joins ...
* [Cloudflare's new reverse proxy - Pingora](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet/): Cloudflare replaced nginx+lua with a proxy server they built in house. They wanted to control the full lifecycle of a request from connection establishment / reuse through to request processing (headers, bodies, etc). Sounds like they're making non-http protocols available as well. (Grpc) I have to admit I was more impressed / interested in what Cloudflare was up to before the KiwiFarms thing. Lost a bit of cred with me there. I'm currently using Cf for a few things related to my blog but I suspect that'll change in the not too distant future.
