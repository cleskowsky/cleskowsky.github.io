title:  "Week 13: distributed systems, ansible profiling, alerts notification prometheus pager"
---

* [A Distributed Systems Reading List](https://ferd.ca/a-distributed-systems-reading-list.html): Good collection of things to think about in distributed systems theory like concensus and failure, clocks and even the network.

* [8 ways to speed up your Ansible playbooks](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/faster-ansible-playbook-execution): There's a very neat profiler built into ansible that I need to remember exists. :)
* [Traefik and Docker: A Discussion with Docker Captain, Bret Fisher](https://traefik.io/blog/traefik-and-docker-a-discussion-with-docker-captain-bret-fisher-7f0b9a54ff88/): A post about traefik
* [Announcing Traefik Proxy v3.0 RC1](https://traefik.io/blog/announcing-traefik-proxy-v3-rc/): Another post about traefik. I love this little proxy server! :)
