title:  "Week 13: distributed systems, ansible profiling"
---

* [A Distributed Systems Reading List](https://ferd.ca/a-distributed-systems-reading-list.html): Good collection of things to think about in distributed systems theory like concensus and failure, clocks and even the network. Fallacies of distributed computing is in here too! (Network is homogenous, bandwidth is infinite, latency is zero, ...)
* [8 ways to speed up your Ansible playbooks](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/faster-ansible-playbook-execution): There's a very neat profiler built into ansible that I need to remember exists. :)
