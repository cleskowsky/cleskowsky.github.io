* [CSS Boost](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2023/06/21/CSS-plus): I have been following Tim Bray's blog for years now. Many thoughtful ideas, freely given, which have brought me joy. :) He talks about finding help to make a handful of small, tasteful tweaks to his site to make it read better in modern clients. Nothing radical about the changes. Looks great.
