# G1: To Infinity and Beyond

- Speaker: Stefan Johansson
- [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckEEncbHGpY)

- Collectors can optimize for 1 or a few of
  - Throughput
  - Latency
  - Memory footprint
- G1 tries to achieve a balance between them (zgc goes for low latency ... sub 1ms pause times achieved!)
- G1 is the default collector in jdk 9+
- Goal: avoid full collections
  - Try to do bulk of work outside full gc span during concurrent steps
- G1 has improved a lot since jdk8 (1000+ patches to this collector)
  - Big improvements in jdk11 + jdk17
