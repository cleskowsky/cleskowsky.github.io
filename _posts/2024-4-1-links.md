* [Thoughtworks Technology Radar April 2024](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar): Always love going through these radar publications and learning about what the various teams at thoughtworks are leaning into in terms of tooling. This time there is:

  * Bruno
  * Infrastructure orchestration platforms, and
  * Podman
