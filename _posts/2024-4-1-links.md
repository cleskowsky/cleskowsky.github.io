* [SREcon24 Americas Recap](https://willgallego.com/2024/03/24/srecon24-americas-recap/): There's a handful of recommended talks in here that all seem like good ones to watch.
* [Thoughtworks Technology Radar April 2024](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar): Always love going through these radar publications and learning about what the various teams at thoughtworks are leaning into in terms of tooling. This time there is:
  * Rancher desktop
  * Bruno
  * Infrastructure orchestration platforms, and
  * Podman
* [The ULTIMATE Raspberry Pi 5 NAS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l30sADfDiM8): Raspberry pi 5 home nas experiment by geerlingguy with 4 ssds. Cost came out to about $150 usd I think for the enclosure not including disks. That's a bit cheaper than others but you have to assembla the kit yourself (very diy) and you own all the h/w and s/w in the device. Lately I've been using my mac mini with external drives attached as a file / media server.
