* [Fixing UUIDv7 (for database use-cases)](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2025/10/22/uuidv7): Sometimes it makes sense to insert db records with primary keys that are increasing for quicker index adds and better spatial locality in terms of clustering data in close together on a disk page. UUID4 is randomly generated like a hash function. When we save data like that, retrieval can appear like random access to disk for range queries. UUID7 starts with a prefix based on a timestamp. There are security concerns about using timestamps around reducing entropy. (Measure of predictability of a soemthing like an id or a password.)
* [OAuth 2.0 Threat Model and Security Considerations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6819): A threat model of the oauth 2 protocol for secure authentication / authorization between a client and server. Included in this thread model is a list of system components that are in scope, assumptions about a system setup, and a list of brainstormed potential attacks per component as well as suggested remediations and criticality of concern. This sort of thing takes time to produce and you get better results by having a group involved.
* [Threat model examples](https://github.com/hysnsec/awesome-threat-modelling?tab=readme-ov-file#threat-model-examples): This is a nice list of different models that can be used as examples.
* [Owasp Threat Modeling Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Threat_Modeling_Cheat_Sheet.html): Consice guide to how to think about this exercise, when to do it, and when to stop with pointers to deeper material.
* [How to approach threat modeling](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-approach-threat-modeling/): Aws article with a high level overview of the phases of threat modelling and how to think about the exercise.
