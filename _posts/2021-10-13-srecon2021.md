# Don't Follow Leaders or "All Models Are Wrong (and So Am I)"

- Speaker: Nial Murphy

- Questions about the sre model as the high watermark of the way we work in operations (Or between operations and dev)
  - It is a model
  - It is not the only model or the last model we will ever have
  - We should keep moving the field forward
- The desire for reliability as a driver for future engineering energy vs other forces (Is it always the most important thing we do? Not always. Fact: It doesn't always win every prioritization battle.)
  - "The value of reliability"
  - There is definitely but it's a more subtle thing
  - Much evidence that reliability can be safely ignored in some cases for some amount of time
- SLOs
  - Value in "social interaction between business and the need / desire for reliability work". eg When to react or not ...
  - SLOs can't distinguish between 1x 100min outage and 100x 1min outage
- Charity Majors: 9s don't matter if the user isn't happy
  - 9s are a proxy for user happiness. There are other measures
  - There's a spectrum of availability and experience for users
    - "What about this infrastructure maps to good human experience?"
- Value in sre
  - Lots of people start and stop here: oncall
  - A couple others
    - preventative measures
    - think about design constraints
