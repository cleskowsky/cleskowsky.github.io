# Don't Follow Leaders or "All Models Are Wrong (and So Am I)"

- Speaker: Nial Murphy
- [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ktzu0qvS6c)

- Questions about the sre model as the high watermark of the way we work in operations (Or between operations and dev)
  - It is a model
  - It is not the only model or the last model we will ever have
  - We should keep moving the field forward
- The desire for reliability as a driver for future engineering energy vs other forces (Is it always the most important thing we do? Not always. Fact: It doesn't always win every prioritization battle.)
  - "The value of reliability"
  - There is definitely but it's a more subtle thing
  - Much evidence that reliability can be safely ignored in some cases for some amount of time
- SLOs
  - Value in "social interaction between business and the need / desire for reliability work". eg When to react or not ...
  - SLOs can't distinguish between 1x 100min outage and 100x 1min outage
- Charity Majors: 9s don't matter if the user isn't happy
  - 9s are a proxy for user happiness. There are other measures
  - There's a spectrum of availability and experience for users
    - "What about this infrastructure maps to good human experience?"
- Value in sre
  - Lots of people start and stop here: oncall
  - A couple others
    - preventative measures
    - think about design constraints

# Optimizing Cost and Performance with arm64

- Speaker: Liz Fong Jones
- [Source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lpwsmCXviQw)

- Dramatic cost + performance improvements for their workloads
- Experiments into new cpu platform performed in small increments over time since it was identified that there could be excitement here just because they were early movers
- Prioritize health / wellbeing of people first whenever experimental work like this is being done
- ARM64 is pretty incredible in terms of cost / performance
  - I think ... 3x boost in amount of work most services were doing (good because their business grew quite a bit in 2020) and only 10% increase in cost because the machines were just that much better
- Kafka was a failure they rolled back. They experienced a few major failures that made them feel it was better to just roll that service back
  - At the time they were doing the migration work kafka hadn't really been run in that environment before at that scale and there were just issues and learnings to chew on
- Java + Go were relatively easy to target the different instruction set of the arm64
  - Java code compiles to intermediate instruction set (Idealized machine?) and then to machine code at runtime
  - Go compiler can be told to produce intel vs arm type instructions in a command line flag
