* [Paper: when resilience engineering questions ergonomics](https://ferd.ca/notes/paper-when-resilience-engineering-questions-ergonomics.html)
    * Work as imagined vs work as done
    * Safety-I vs Safety-II
        * Safety-I focuses on avoiding failure, attention to adverse events, and root causes (Older analysis model)
        * Safety-II is about studying how systems get to good outcomes in a changing environment (considering both good
          and bad adversities). Looking at how good outcomes happen which is hopefully how most system events turn out (
          Newer analysis model)
    * Gap between the two and how to bridge
    * Gradually draw WAI to WAD by observing system interactions with healthy outcomes and building limits, processes,
      knowledge sharing activities around that
