- Write tests to requirements. Make sure the feature you’re building for a customer does what it needs to do. Test the value! This could mean integration, and end to end testing. Units are great but there’s more to think about

## From Google

- Lots to think about in chapter 12. On my mind right now is a new classification of tests as small, medium, and large
  - Small tests are less brittle and fast – they don’t leave the test process,
  - Mediums are slower and fail sometimes – they can call out to another process but don’t leave a machine, and
  - Larges are expensive to maintain and flakey in general – they involve multiple processes between separate machine hosts sending messages across an unreliable network
