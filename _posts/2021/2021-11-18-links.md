* [Ably load testing](https://ably.com/blog/how-we-load-tested-control-api): describes how ably load tested a new api service they built to programmatically control how their integration platform works for users. They used locust for load generation and talk about simulating different kinds of users (good, bad, dumb). They also talked about how they scaled up to multiple simulated users. Nice write up!
