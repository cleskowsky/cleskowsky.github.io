# The most important advice I've ever read about reviewing code ...

![The most important advice I've ever read about reviewing code comes from Cindy Sridharan. The best comments were about concurrency bugs, software layering, and how to write better tests. The worst talked about making functions smaller and clean code.](/assets/2023/reviewing_code.png)

# Reading

* [Thoughtful code reviews](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2021/03/09/tips-for-better-code-review/): as practiced at Gitlab
* [Conventional comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/): is an idea I like a lot. Make your intent obvious when you say something about code and include as much context as you can
  * eg suggestion (security): I think there may be an issue here â€¦

Code reviews are a most excellent opportunity to share experience about a program or the way a team thinks about work! The goal is to share context, and potentially relevant personal experience with the author about a problem / solution, and to spot things that could bite you. Nitpicking is not helpful!

# The Review

* Does it work? ðŸ˜†
* Show me the tests! Seeing tests brings me joy! ðŸ¥°
* Is it easy to understand and written simply? Avoid the clever. Readability is super important. This canâ€™t be overstated
* Focus on the interesting bits. Eg:
  * Concurrency
  * New libraries / dependencies
    * Whatâ€™s the license? LGPL and Apache licenses are acceptible (Others could be onerous and should be scrutinized. Avoid copyleft â€¦)
  * Error handling (See below)
  * Remote calls
    * What if your dependency isnâ€™t available or slow to respond? Have we thought about the failure case? (Timeouts [both connection, read], circuit breaker)
    * Retries if it makes sense (idempotent action), and backoff
  * Db usage
    * Can we be caching here
    * Do we have / need an index for this? Is the new feature on a hot code path?

# Error Handling

* Are exceptions being captured and an error report being created for issues we can do something about?
  * Yes â€“ bad configuration in a client, or module leading to failure
  * No â€“ bad user input (eg Somebody entered a birthdate in a form not in the right format causing our input validation layer to fail)
* Otherwise log (Or maybe log in addition to?)
* Handle specific exceptions you know may be thrown, and include a generic handler for everything else
* Propagate errors out to the places where they can be handled
