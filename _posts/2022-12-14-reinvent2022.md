Conference videos came out really early this year. I like to write down the highlights for me as I go so this is a post for that. I will not be watching all the things. That would be insane.

* [Build production-ready prototypes rapidly using serverless patterns (ARC311-R)](https://youtu.be/Q2OY55gaOjw)
  * Excellent end to end talk of building a prototype quickly to prod with the correct amount of energy from the team along the way
  * Serverless components are used to help minimize code but you end up with lots of config related to describing serverless things and how they connect. You're always tightly bound to aws but this is a tradeoff.
  * Do you actually get developer velocity gains + other things like observability baked in at least somewhat?
  * CDK and SAM from AWS provide predefined higher order constructs that could help speed things along (eg apigateway + cognito -> lambda -> dynamo)
  * Parameter store is used to eliminate direct dependencies between stacks, and other system resources
