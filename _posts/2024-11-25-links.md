* [Announcing Deno 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d35SlRgVxT8): Runs javascript code outside a browser. Looks to make stuff faster, safer and easier. I liked the demo of some of the capabilities of deno. Reminded me of the golang toolchain somewhat where most everything command is baked into the `deno ...` command itself. My favourite is probably `deno compile` that produces a single executable file including a minimal deno runtime and your code. (Javascript can't be compiled down to machine code just yet - it's a hard problem for very high level dynamic languages!)
* [Announcing Deno 2 (Blog post accompanied by above video)](https://deno.com/blog/v2.0): Very cool list of features. Every language ecosystem should have a toolchain like this.
* [To the Moon • Russ Olsen • GOTO 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntmkMLcveC0): Story told of how man made it to the moon in the missions leading up to and including Apollo 11.
* [SREcon24 Americas - Scam or Savings? A Cloud vs. On-Prem Economic Slapfight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30q6fT_8aWc&list=PLbRoZ5Rrl5lcEA4oaH-yTD6R9jlckfmBH&index=2): Talks about cloud exit, (thinks it's not a thing - is that true? certainly it's true that dhh is talking about it alot and I'm not sure I've heard examples of any other) on prem vs on cloud.
