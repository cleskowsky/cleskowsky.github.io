* [Reflections on 10,000 Hours of Programming](https://matt-rickard.com/reflections-on-10-000-hours-of-programming/): List of programming tips from a senior developer. A few takeaways for me:
  * If it looks ugly it's a terrible mistake
  * Know your important tools inside and out (eg git, bash)
  * Simple is hard
* [3 rules for staffing an ops team](https://twitter.com/alexpotato/status/1440996174790631424?s=12): Yeah these hit home pretty hard
  * You need enough people
  * You need at least one person who knows most of what's going on
  * You need a high average knowledge of the system
