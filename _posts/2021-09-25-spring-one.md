title:  "Spring One 2021"

The SpringOne virtual conference has come and gone this year (earlier in September I think) and I'm finally coming around to watching some of the talks there that look interesting to me. Spring security, observability and boot are high up there for me these days.

[Juergen Talks About Spring6](https://springone.io/2021/sessions/from-spring-framework-5-3-to-6-0): Currently slated for October 2022 so not that imminent but they'll be focusing on observability and an upgrade to jakarta ee 9 namespacing for the servlet api (Thanks for that Oracle! We love you.) among other things.
