* [5 Dashboard Design Best Practices](https://www.influxdata.com/blog/5-dashboard-design-best-practices/?ck_subscriber_id=185275687): How to make a dashboard that serves a specific purpose and considers who will be using it. 3 broad kinds : operational (near real-time), analytic (drill down, dimensional, not real-time), strategic (higher level than analytic, not real-time)
  * Information hierarchy - Users look in the top left corner first and move outward from there. Most impactful info should be positioned here and sized appropriately
  * Consistent layout - Use of titles, legends, axes, scale should be consistent / well-thought-out for the data you're looking at
  * Provide context - Explain to people what they're looking at (use of titles, subtitles, tooltips etc)
  * The first 5 seconds - A user should be able to find what they need in < 5s
  * Performance - Make sure your dashboard is usable with real datasets (toy dashboards only work with tiny amounts of data)
