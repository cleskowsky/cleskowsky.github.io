* [Mastodon scaling, "Truth" Social](https://mastodon.social/@blaine/109343460155840764): Users with million of followers flipped to pull based message delivery. (Users with a small number of followers push statuses. This is the vast majority.) There was some talk of making high fanout users pay for the privilege since what we looking at is a large scale broadcast mechanism at some point which is hard and expensive. (Twitter never did this but considered it.)
