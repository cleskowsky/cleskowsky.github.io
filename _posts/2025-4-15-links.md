* [SSL/TLS Strong Encryption: FAQ](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/ssl/ssl_faq.html): Neat stuff in here about mtls, generating server certs, troubleshooting, and tls related configuration bits
* [Optimizing Our E2E Pipeline](https://slack.engineering/speedup-e2e-testing/): Skip frontend build if there's no change in a commit and just used artifacts from a previous build
* [A Clean Approach to Process Optimization](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3722546): Do things seemingly out of order, do things lazily or not at all, and sometimes it makes sense to break up a workflow into smaller ones (in the example of customer environments in the article there was a base workflow every every customer needed and customizations which varied and that split helped make their process more efficient)
* [30 Minutes With MCP and flyctl](https://fly.io/blog/30-minute-mcp/): Simple example of how an mcp server running locally with access to a cloud host provider can be used to investigate a server problem
* [Guiding an LLM for Robust Java ByteBuffer Code](https://martinfowler.com/articles/exploring-gen-ai/14-guiding-llm-java-bytebuffer.html): Conversation to develop a java class. The developer has to correct the generated code and keep prompt the llm until the code is correct.
* [Apache Iceberg™ | What It Is and Why Everyone’s Talking About It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsmhRZElPvM): Analytics data in object storage with a bunch of metadata about what's stored and how sitting as layers above that (parquet (columnar data storage format), manifest files, metadata, catalog)
