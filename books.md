## Slides

- [Why Cloud Zombies Are Destroying the Planet and How You Can Stop Them](/assets/2023/zombies.pdf): Absolutely fantastic. Turn it off! LightSwitchOps - turning off and back on again should be easy and just work. Don't make it hard for people to get servers - they won't give them back! (Attachment.)
- [An incredible slide deck from a project manager on the Return to Monkey Island game team](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fG7C1vBr6jelH-xbYs7NFJDiJTSvaLG1/view?usp=drive_link): So good!
  - [A link to the gdc talk which was also excellent](https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1029361/The-Production-Secrets-of-Return)
  - Talk summary : Gain production insights from Return to Monkey Island's lead producer, Jenn Sandercock, about the two-year development cycle, working with an iconic IP, and building a no-crunch, fully remote team of 25 people in absolute secrecy. Learn the skills that allowed Return to Monkey Island to be completely playable within the first four months of development and the iterative process that followed.This talk is not a postmortem. It's a shipload of production-focused tips and techniques in small, digestible, rapid-fire, and actionable nuggets. All the tips will come with detailed, concrete examples of how we implemented them.

## Articles

- [Influence: Lessons from a Staff Engineer and ex-Twitter 8-year Tech Lead](/assets/papers_we_love/Lessons%20from%20a%20Staff%20Engineer%20and%20ex-Twitter%208-year%20Tech%20Lead.pdf): Aligns very well with how I think about working with others, well written. Will probably re-read this from time to time to help me remember.
- [Questions for a new technology](https://kellanem.com/notes/new-tech): Love these. There should be some friction to adding a new technology to a team / system. Ongoing maintenance and operational burn trumps dev cost:
  1. What problem are we trying to solve? (Tech should never be introduced as an end to itself)
  2. How could we solve the problem with our current tech stack? (If the answer is we can’t, then we probably haven’t thought about the problem deeply enough)
  3. Are we clear on what new costs we are taking on with the new technology? (monitoring, training, cognitive load, etc)
  4. What about our current stack makes solving this problem in a cost-effective manner (in terms of money, people or time) difficult?
  5. If this new tech is a replacement for something we currently do, are we committed to moving everything to this new technology in the future? Or are we proliferating multiple solutions to the same problem? (aka “Will this solution kill and eat the solution that it replaces?”)
  6. Who do we know and trust who uses this tech? Have we talked to them about it? What did they say about it? What don’t they like about it? (if they don’t hate it, they haven’t used it in depth yet)
  7. What’s a low risk way to get started?
  8. Have you gotten a mixed discipline group of senior folks together and thrashed out each of the above points? Where is that documented?
- [12 factor app](https://12factor.net/): Good practices here in terms of architecting and operating an application.
- [Gov.uk design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/): A thorough guide to designing web applications / pages that are accessible and consistent. Very well put together and thought through.
- [Above the Line, Below the Line](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3380777): So many good ideas here.
  - Mental model is often not quite right because the system is changing constantly
  - Collaborative effort is needed to operate systems
  - People and views of a system work above a line of representations (different points of view of status / state)
  - A system includes the people that operate it - not just the code
- [Jakob's 10 Usability Heuristics](/assets/2023/jakob_neilsen_ten_usability_heuristics.pdf): Beautiful presentation of important ideas
- [Delivery Hero's Reliability Manifesto](https://tech.deliveryhero.com/our-reliability-manifesto/?ck_subscriber_id=185275687)
  - [PDF printed copy of above](/assets/2023/Delivery_Hero_Reliability_Manifesto.pdf)
- [10 technical strategies to avoid when scaling your startup (and 5 to embrace)](https://www.intercom.com/blog/ten-technical-strategies-to-avoid-when-scaling-your-startup-and-five-to-embrace/): I'm sure I've bookmarked this before, but it's just so good.

## Articles

- [Best Practice: Application Frameworks](/assets/Best_Practice_Application_Frameworks.pdf): Great article that talks about why frameworks. Benefits vs tradeoffs. I need to re-read this!
- [OpenTelemetry and the Ghost of Provisioning Past](https://metal.equinix.com/blog/opentelemetry-provisioning-observability-distributed-tracing/): In which Amy talks about the road to opentelemetry in a system she was tasked with bringing better observability to. Quite the journey. Bit of a reminder to me that there is a cost to a migration like this. (Hopefully not always as painful as this story but certainly non-zero.)
- [Microservices to macro](https://twitter.com/copyconstruct/status/1525860086685478912): This sounds right to me. I guess we don't really want microservices per se. What we want is to be able to safely deploy new code / bug fixes whenever we want, and we'd like to be able to tell whether our code is healthy or not.
  - "Microservices are hard!"
- [Coordination avoidance](https://brooker.co.za/blog/2021/01/22/cloud-scale.html): Scaling out a distributed system is achieved by breaking up work and can be done with replication, sharding, caching and possibly other things I can't think of now or remember. Something I would not consider is the gains related to avoiding the cost of coordination altogether!

## Videos

* [Ryan Singer: Designing from start to finish](https://vimeo.com/16814487): This is great. I like watch people who are great at their craft make things. Doesn't have to be software related but this is.

- Taming Thymeleaf: I liked it. Very practical guide to building a webapp from the frontend to backend with security and persistence using spring boot and related modules. Will be a good reference I'm thinking.
