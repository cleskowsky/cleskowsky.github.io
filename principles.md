# Some big ideas that have been super beneficial to me in my life

1. Grateful. Being alive, today, and healthy with Carmen is a gift. What will I do with this new day I’ve been given?
2. With intent. Pick my priorities carefully. Don’t let the world do this for me
3. Subtract. Let go of things, and goals that don’t fill me up. Don’t ever take on too much. Is this thing bringing me joy?
4. Learn from mistakes. Never stop reaching and growing. Failure is part of all change
5. Incompetence not malice. “Never attribute to malice what could be incompetence.” Most people aren’t evil, but they do make mistakes, and they don’t know what they don’t know
6. Listen
7. ["In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, in the expert’s mind there are few."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) The quicker I get to solutioning, the sooner I leave the land of possibilities!
